As my classmate took a full swing, the bat\nslipped out of his hands and came flying toward me before striking me\ndirectly between the eyes. I have no memory of the moment of impact.\nThe bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose\ninto a distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain\nslamming into the inside of my skull. Immediately , a wave of swelling\nsurged throughout my head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose,\nmultiple skull fractures, and two shattered eye sockets.\nWhen I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to\nhelp. I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my\nclassmates took the shirt of f his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug\nthe stream of blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I\nwas unaware of how seriously I had been injured.\nMy teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long\nwalk to the nurse’ s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into\nschool. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. W e took our\ntime and walked slowly . Nobody realized that every minute mattered.\nWhen we arrived at the nurse’ s office, she asked me a series of\nquestions.\n“What year is it?”\n“1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.\n“Who is the president of the United States?”\n“Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was Geor ge W . Bush.\n“What is your mom’ s name?”' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 7}page_content='“Uh. Um.” I stalled. T en seconds passed.\n“Patti,” I said casually , ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds\nto remember my own mother ’s name.\nThat is the last question I remember . My body was unable to handle the\nrapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance\narrived. Minutes later , I was carried out of school and taken to the local\nhospital.\nShortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with\nbasic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the\nday. Then I stopped breathing entirely . As the doctors hurried to supply me\nwith oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle\nthe situation and ordered a helicopter to fly me to a lar ger hospital in\nCincinnati.\nI was rolled out of the emer gency room doors and toward the helipad\nacross the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse\npushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My\nmother , who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into\nthe helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on\nmy own as she held my hand during the flight.\nWhile my mother rode with me in the helicopter , my father went home\nto check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked\nback tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade\ngraduation ceremony that night. After passing my siblings of f to family and\nfriends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother .\nWhen my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly\ntwenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into\nthe trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so\nsevere that I was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones\nneeded to be fixed, but I was in no condition to under go sur gery. After yet\nanother seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced\ncoma and placed on a ventilator .\nMy parents were no strangers to this hospital. T en years earlier , they had\nentered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed\nwith leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six\nmonths old. After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal\ntaps, and bone marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 8}page_content='hospital happy , healthy , and cancer free. And now , after ten years of normal\nlife, my parents found themselves back in the same place with a dif ferent\nchild.\nWhile I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social\nworker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with\nthem a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer .\nAs day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents\nslept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse\nfrom fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with worry . My mother\nwould tell me later , “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”\nMY RECOVER Y\nMercifully , by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point\nwhere the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I\nfinally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to\nsmell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and snif f an apple juice\nbox. My sense of smell returned, but—to everyone’ s surprise—the act of\nblowing my nose forced air through the fractures in my eye socket and\npushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held\nprecariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve attaching my eye to\nmy brain.\nThe ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place\nas the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was\nscheduled for sur gery one week later , which would allow me some\nadditional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a\nboxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned home with\na broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging left eye.\nThe following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on\npause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’ t see straight. It took\nmore than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal\nlocation. Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months\nbefore I could drive a car again. At physical therapy , I practiced basic motor\npatterns like walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 9}page_content='get me down, but there were more than a few moments when I felt\ndepressed and overwhelmed.\nI became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the\nbaseball field one year later . Baseball had always been a major part of my\nlife. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals,\nand I had a dream of playing professionally , too. After months of\nrehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get back on the\nfield.\nBut my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled\naround, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was\nsent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity . I had been playing\nsince age four , and for someone who had spent so much time and ef fort on\nthe sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it\nhappened. I sat in my car and cried as I flipped through the radio,\ndesperately searching for a song that would make me feel better .\nAfter a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a\nsenior , but I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven innings of\nhigh school varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.\nDespite my lackluster high school career , I still believed I could become\na great player . And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the\none responsible for making it happen. The turning point came two years\nafter my injury , when I began college at Denison University . It was a new\nbeginning, and it was the place where I would discover the surprising power\nof small habits for the first time.\nHOW I LEARNED ABOUT HABITS\nAttending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot\non the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the roster as a\nfreshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had\nmanaged to become a college athlete.\nI wasn’ t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I\nfocused on getting my life in order . While my peers stayed up late and\nplayed video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each\nnight. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 10}page_content='room neat and tidy . These improvements were minor , but they gave me a\nsense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this\ngrowing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study\nhabits and managed to earn straight A ’s during my first year .\nA habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in\nmany cases, automatically . As each semester passed, I accumulated small\nbut consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to\nme when I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a\nhabit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed,\nmy six-foot-four -inch frame bulked up from a featherweight 170 to a lean\n200 pounds.\nWhen my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the\npitching staf f. By my junior year , I was voted team captain and at the end of\nthe season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until\nmy senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training\nhabits really began to pay of f.\nSix years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the\nhospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at\nDenison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America T eam\n—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the country . By the time\nI graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight dif ferent\ncategories. That same year , I was awarded the university’ s highest academic\nhonor , the President’ s Medal.\nI hope you’ll for give me if this sounds boastful. T o be honest, there was\nnothing legendary or historic about my athletic career . I never ended up\nplaying professionally . However , looking back on those years, I believe I\naccomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my potential. And I believe\nthe concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well.\nWe all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the\nexperience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and\nunimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing\nto stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run,\nthe quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. W ith the\nsame habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits,\nanything is possible.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 11}page_content='Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I\ndon’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’ t\none defining moment on my journey from medically induced coma to\nAcademic All-American; there were many . It was a gradual evolution, a\nlong series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made\nprogress—the only choice I had—was to start small. And I employed this\nsame strategy a few years later when I started my own business and began\nworking on this book.\nHOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK\nIn November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear .com. For\nyears, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits\nand I was finally ready to share some of them publicly . I began by\npublishing a new article every Monday and Thursday . Within a few months,\nthis simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and\nby the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand\npeople.\nIn 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand\nsubscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the\ninternet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier ,\nbut now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that\nexcited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a\nmaster of the topic, but rather someone who was experimenting alongside\nmy readers.\nIn 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a\nbook deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are\nreading now . As my audience grew , so did my business opportunities. I was\nincreasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit\nformation, behavior change, and continuous improvement. I found myself\ndelivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.\nIn 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications like\nTime , Entrepreneur  , and Forbes  . Incredibly , my writing was read by over\neight million people that year . Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began\nreading my work and sharing it with their teams.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 12}page_content='At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy , which became the\npremier training platform for or ganizations and individuals interested in\nbuilding better habits in life and work.  * Fortune 500 companies and\ngrowing start-ups began to enroll their leaders and train their staf f. In total,\nover ten thousand leaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have graduated\nfrom the Habits Academy , and my work with them has taught me an\nincredible amount about what it takes to make habits work in the real world.\nAs I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear .com is\nreceiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred thousand\npeople subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far\nbeyond my expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think\nof it.\nHOW THIS BOOK WILL BENEFIT YOU\nThe entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “T o write a great\nbook, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about the ideas\nmentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to\nrebound from my injury , to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high\nlevel on the field, to become a writer , to build a successful business, and\nsimply to develop into a responsible adult. Small habits helped me fulfill\nmy potential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to\nfulfill yours as well.\nIn the pages that follow , I will share a step-by-step plan for building\nbetter habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science\nsupports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research\npaper; it’ s an operating manual. Y ou’ll find wisdom and practical advice\nfront and center as I explain the science of how to create and change your\nhabits in a way that is easy to understand and apply .\nThe fields I draw on—biology , neuroscience, philosophy , psychology ,\nand more—have been around for many years. What I of fer you is a\nsynthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well\nas the most compelling discoveries scientists have made recently . My\ncontribution, I hope, is to find the ideas that matter most and connect them\nin a way that is highly actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 13}page_content='credit to the many experts who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is\nmy error .\nThe backbone of this book is my four -step model of habits—cue,\ncraving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that\nevolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may\nrecognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first\nproposed as “  stimulus, response, reward” by B. F . Skinner in the 1930s and\nhas been popularized more recently as “  cue, routine, reward” in The Power\nof Habit  by Charles Duhigg.\nBehavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you of fered the right\nreward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way . But\nwhile Skinner ’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external\nstimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our\nthoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior . Internal states—our\nmoods and emotions—matter , too. In recent decades, scientists have begun\nto determine the connection between our thoughts, feelings, and behavior .\nThis research will also be covered in these pages.\nIn total, the framework I of fer is an integrated model of the cognitive\nand behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human\nbehavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and\ninternal emotions on our habits. While some of the language may be\nfamiliar , I am confident that the details—and the applications of the Four\nLaws of Behavior Change—will of fer a new way to think about your habits.\nHuman behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to\nmoment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’ t change. It’ s\nabout the fundamentals of human behavior . The lasting principles you can\nrely on year after year . The ideas you can build a business around, build a\nfamily around, build a life around.\nThere is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes\nthe best way I know—an approach that will be ef fective regardless of where\nyou start or what you’re trying to change. The strategies I cover will be\nrelevant to anyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement,\nwhether your goals center on health, money , productivity , relationships, or\nall of the above. As long as human behavior is involved, this book will be\nyour guide.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 14}page_content='THE  \nFUNDAMENT ALS\nWhy Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 15}page_content='T\n1\nThe Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\nHE F ATE OF British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The or ganization,\nwhich was the governing body for professional cycling in Great\nBritain, had recently hired Dave Brailsford as its new performance director .\nAt the time, professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one\nhundred years of mediocrity . Since 1908, British riders had won just a\nsingle gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in\ncycling’ s biggest race, the T our de France. In 1 10 years, no British cyclist\nhad ever won the event.\nIn fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming\nthat one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the\nteam because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals\nsaw the Brits using their gear .\nBrailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory .\nWhat made him dif ferent from previous coaches was his relentless\ncommitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of mar ginal\ngains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny mar gin of\nimprovement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “  The whole principle\ncame from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of\nthat goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a\nsignificant increase when you put them all together .”\nBrailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you\nmight expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 16}page_content='seats to make them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a\nbetter grip. They asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to\nmaintain ideal muscle temperature while riding and used biofeedback\nsensors to monitor how each athlete responded to a particular workout. The\nteam tested various fabrics in a wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders\nswitch to indoor racing suits, which proved to be lighter and more\naerodynamic.\nBut they didn’ t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1\npercent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested\ndifferent types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle\nrecovery . They hired a sur geon to teach each rider the best way to wash\ntheir hands to reduce the chances of catching a cold. They determined the\ntype of pillow and mattress that led to the best night’ s sleep for each rider .\nThey even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them\nspot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could\ndegrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.\nAs these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the\nresults came faster than anyone could have imagined.\nJust five years after Brailsford took over , the British Cycling team\ndominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in\nBeijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals\navailable. Four years later , when the Olympic Games came to London, the\nBrits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world\nrecords.\nThat same year , Bradley W iggins became the first British cyclist to win\nthe T our de France. The next year , his teammate Chris Froome won the\nrace, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the\nBritish team five T our de France victories in six years.\nDuring the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178\nworld championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and\ncaptured five T our de France victories in what is widely regarded as the\nmost successful run in cycling history . *\nHow does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes\ntransform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance,\nwould seem to make a modest dif ference at best? Why do small' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 17}page_content='improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you\nreplicate this approach in your own life?\nWHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIt is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and\nunderestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.\nToo often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive\naction. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book,\nwinning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on\nourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will\ntalk about.\nMeanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’ t particularly notable—\nsometimes it isn’ t even noticeable  —but it can be far more meaningful,\nespecially in the long run. The dif ference a tiny improvement can make\nover time is astounding. Here’ s how the math works out: if you can get 1\npercent better each day for one year , you’ll end up thirty-seven times better\nby the time you’re done. Conversely , if you get 1 percent worse each day\nfor one year , you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win\nor a minor setback accumulates into something much more.\n1% BETTER EVER Y DA Y\n1% worse every day for one year . 0.99365 = 00.03\n1% better every day for one year . 1.01365 = 37.78' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 18}page_content='FIGURE 1:  The ef fects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you\ncan get just 1 percent better each day , you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37\ntimes better after one year .\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way\nthat money multiplies through compound interest, the ef fects of your habits\nmultiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little dif ference on any\ngiven day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be\nenormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later\nthat the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly\napparent.\nThis can be a dif ficult concept to appreciate in daily life. W e often\ndismiss small changes because they don’ t seem to matter very much in the\nmoment. If you save a little money now , you’re still not a millionaire. If you\ngo to the gym three days in a row , you’re still out of shape. If you study\nMandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’ t learned the language. W e' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 19}page_content='make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we\nslide back into our previous routines.\nUnfortunately , the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a\nbad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today , the scale doesn’ t move\nmuch. If you work late tonight and ignore your family , they will for give\nyou. If you procrastinate and put your project of f until tomorrow , there will\nusually be time to finish it later . A single decision is easy to dismiss.\nBut when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day , by replicating poor\ndecisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our\nsmall choices compound into toxic results. It’ s the accumulation of many\nmissteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a\nproblem.\nThe impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the ef fect of\nshifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are\nflying from Los Angeles to New Y ork City . If a pilot leaving from LAX\nadjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in W ashington,\nD.C., instead of New Y ork. Such a small change is barely noticeable at\ntakeof f—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when\nmagnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles\napart.  *\nSimilarly , a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a\nvery dif ferent destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1\npercent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of\nmoments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the dif ference\nbetween who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily\nhabits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.\nThat said, it doesn’ t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right\nnow. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path\ntoward success. Y ou should be far more concerned with your current\ntrajectory than with your current results. If you’re a millionaire but you\nspend more than you earn each month, then you’re on a bad trajectory . If\nyour spending habits don’ t change, it’ s not going to end well. Conversely , if\nyou’re broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you’re on the path\ntoward financial freedom—even if you’re moving slower than you’d like.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Y our net worth is a\nlagging measure of your financial habits. Y our weight is a lagging measure' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 20}page_content='of your eating habits. Y our knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning\nhabits. Y our clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. Y ou get\nwhat you repeat.\nIf you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is\nfollow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices\nwill compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less\nthan you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are\nyou reading books and learning something new each day? T iny battles like\nthese are the ones that will define your future self.\nTime magnifies the mar gin between success and failure. It will multiply\nwhatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally . Bad habits make\ntime your enemy .\nHabits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as\neasily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the\ndetails is crucial. Y ou need to know how habits work and how to design\nthem to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\nYOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU\nPositive Compounding\nProductivity compounds. Accomplishing one extra task is a small feat on any given day , but it\ncounts for a lot over an entire career . The ef fect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill\ncan be even greater . The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to\nfocus on other areas.\nKnowledge compounds.  Learning one new idea won’ t make you a genius, but a commitment to\nlifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you\nsomething new but also opens up dif ferent ways of thinking about old ideas. As W arren Buf fett\nsays, “That’ s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”\nRelationships compound.  People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the\nmore others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of\nbroad and strong connections over time.\nNegative Compounding\nStress compounds.  The frustration of a traf fic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The\nworry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these\ncommon causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound\ninto serious health issues.\nNegative thoughts compound.  The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly , the\nmore you condition yourself to interpret life that way . You get trapped in a thought loop. The same' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 21}page_content='is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry ,\nunjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\nOutrage compounds.  Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event.\nInstead, a long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event\ntips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire.\nWHA T PROGRESS IS REALL Y LIKE\nImagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The\nroom is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five\ndegrees. Ever so slowly , the room begins to heat up.\nTwenty-six degrees.\nTwenty-seven.\nTwenty-eight.\nThe ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.\nTwenty-nine degrees.\nThirty .\nThirty-one.\nStill, nothing has happened.\nThen, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift,\nseemingly no dif ferent from the temperature increases before it, has\nunlocked a huge change.\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions,\nwhich build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This\npattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life\nundetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be\nseen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems under ground\nbefore exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\nSimilarly , habits often appear to make no dif ference until you cross a\ncritical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and\nmiddle stages of any quest, there is often a V alley of Disappointment. Y ou\nexpect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’ s frustrating how\nineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months.\nIt doesn’ t feel like you are going anywhere. It’ s a hallmark of any\ncompounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 22}page_content='This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last.\nPeople make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to\nstop. Y ou think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’ t I\nsee any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over , it’s easy\nto let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful\ndifference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau\n—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential  .\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one,\nit is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because\nyou have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about\nnot achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice\ncube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.\nYour work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at\nthirty-two degrees.\nWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people\nwill call it an overnight success. The outside world only sees the most\ndramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’ s the\nwork you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’ t making any\nprogress—that makes the jump today possible.\nIt is the human equivalent of geological pressure. T wo tectonic plates\ncan grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly\nbuilding all the while. Then, one day , they rub each other once again, in the\nsame fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An\nearthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once.\nMastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most\nsuccessful teams in NBA history , have a quote from social reformer Jacob\nRiis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and\nlook at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times\nwithout as much as a crack showing in it. Y et at the hundred and first blow\nit will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all\nthat had gone before.”\nTHE PLA TEAU OF LA TENT POTENTIAL' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 23}page_content='FIGURE 2:  We often expect progress to be linear . At the very least, we hope it\nwill come quickly . In reality , the results of our ef forts are often delayed. It is not\nuntil months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we\nhave done. This can result in a “valley of disappointment” where people feel\ndiscouraged after putting in weeks or months of hard work without experiencing\nany results. However , this work was not wasted. It was simply being stored. It is\nnot until much later that the full value of previous ef forts is revealed.\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a\nsingle, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and\ngrows stronger . Roots entrench themselves and branches grow . The task of\nbreaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. And the\ntask of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at\na time.\nBut what determines whether we stick with a habit long enough to\nsurvive the Plateau of Latent Potential and break through to the other side?\nWhat is it that causes some people to slide into unwanted habits and enables\nothers to enjoy the compounding ef fects of good ones?\nFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 24}page_content='Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life\n—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more\nand worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set\nspecific, actionable goals.\nFor many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one\nwas a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school,\nfor the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in\nbusiness. I succeeded at a few , but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually , I\nbegan to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and\nnearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\nWhat’ s the dif ference between systems and goals? It’ s a distinction I first\nlearned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind the Dilbert  comic. Goals\nare about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes\nthat lead to those results.\nIf you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Y our\nsystem is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches,\nand conduct practice.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur , your goal might be to build a million-dollar\nbusiness. Y our system is how you test product ideas, hire employees,\nand run marketing campaigns.\nIf you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Y our\nsystem is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle\ndifficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your\ninstructor .\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals\nand focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if\nyou were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a\nchampionship and focused only on what your team does at practice each\nday, would you still get results?\nI think you would.\nThe goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be\nridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way\nto actually win is to get better each day . In the words of three-time Super' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 25}page_content='Bowl winner Bill W alsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true\nfor other areas of life. If you want better results, then for get about setting\ngoals. Focus on your system instead.\nWhat do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not.\nGoals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making\nprogress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time\nthinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\nProblem #1: W inners and losers have the same goals.\nGoal setting suf fers from a serious case of survivorship bias. W e\nconcentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and\nmistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while\noverlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’ t\nsucceed.\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to\nget the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals,\nthen the goal cannot be what dif ferentiates the winners from the losers. It\nwasn’ t the goal of winning the T our de France that propelled the British\ncyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably , they had wanted to win the race\nevery year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had\nalways been there. It was only when they implemented a system  of\ncontinuous small improvements that they achieved a dif ferent outcome.\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you\nsummon the ener gy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now .\nBut if you maintain the same sloppy , pack-rat habits that led to a messy\nroom in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and\nhoping for another burst of motivation. Y ou’re left chasing the same\noutcome because you never changed the system behind it. Y ou treated a\nsymptom without addressing the cause.\nAchieving a goal only changes your life for the moment  . That’ s the\ncounterintuitive thing about improvement. W e think we need to change our' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 26}page_content='results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change\nare the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the\nresults level, you only solve them temporarily . In order to improve for good,\nyou need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the\noutputs will fix themselves.\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal,\nthen I’ll be happy .” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re\ncontinually putting happiness of f until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into\nthis trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always\nsomething for my future self to enjoy . I promised myself that once I gained\ntwenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New Y ork\nTimes , then I could finally relax.\nFurthermore, goals create an “either -or” conflict: either you achieve your\ngoal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. Y ou\nmentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is\nmisguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the\nexact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to\nrestrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to\nsuccess.\nA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love\nwith the process rather than the product, you don’ t have to wait to give\nyourself permission to be happy . You can be satisfied anytime your system\nis running. And a system can be successful in many dif ferent forms, not just\nthe one you first envision.\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\nFinally , a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” ef fect. Many runners\nwork hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop\ntraining. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your\nhard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 27}page_content='after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to\ntheir old habits after accomplishing a goal.\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building\nsystems is to continue playing the game. T rue long-term thinking is goal-\nless thinking. It’ s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle\nof endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately , it is your\ncommitment to the process  that will determine your progress .\nA SYSTEM OF A TOMIC HABITS\nIf you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’ t you. The\nproblem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not\nbecause you don’ t want to change, but because you have the wrong system\nfor change.\nYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your\nsystems.\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the\ncore themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the\nword atomic  . By now , you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers\nto a tiny change, a mar ginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic\nhabits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that\nare part of a lar ger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of\nmolecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\nHabits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit\nthat contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines\nseem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins\nthat multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial\ninvestment. They are both small and mighty . This is the meaning of the\nphrase atomic habits  —a regular practice or routine that is not only small\nand easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the\nsystem of compound growth.\nChapter Summary' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 28}page_content='Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1\npercent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.\nHabits are a double-edged sword.

And yet it is likely that this time next year\nyou’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better .\nIt often feels dif ficult to keep good habits going for more than a few\ndays, even with sincere ef fort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits\nlike exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day\nor two and then become a hassle.\nHowever , once your habits are established, they seem to stick around\nforever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions,\nunhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television,\nprocrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change\nthe wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way . In\nthis chapter , I’ll address the first point. In the chapters that follow , I’ll\nanswer the second.\nOur first mistake is that we try to change the wrong thing. T o understand\nwhat I mean, consider that there are three levels at which change can occur .\nYou can imagine them like the layers of an onion.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 30}page_content='THREE LA YERS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\nFIGURE 3:  There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your\noutcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity .\nThe first layer is changing your outcomes.  This level is concerned\nwith changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a\nchampionship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of\nchange.\nThe second layer is changing your pr ocess.  This level is concerned\nwith changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the\ngym, decluttering your desk for better workflow , developing a meditation\npractice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.\nThe third and deepest layer is changing your identity . This level is\nconcerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview , your self-image,\nyour judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions,\nand biases you hold are associated with this level.\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do.\nIdentity is about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that\nlast—when it comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements—the\nproblem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another . All levels' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 31}page_content='of change are useful in their own way . The problem is the dir ection  of\nchange.\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on\nwhat  they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The\nalternative is to build identity-based habits. W ith this approach, we start by\nfocusing on who we wish to become.\nOUTCOME-BASED HABITS\nIDENTITY -BASED HABITS\nFIGURE 4:  With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to\nachieve. W ith identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When of fered a smoke, the first\nperson says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 32}page_content='response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be\nsomething else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying\naround the same beliefs.\nThe second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker .”\nIt’s a small dif ference, but this statement signals a shift in identity . Smoking\nwas part of their former life, not their current one. They no longer identify\nas someone who smokes.\nMost people don’ t even consider identity change when they set out to\nimprove. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to\nthis diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the\nactions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the\nbeliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at\nthemselves, and they don’ t realize that their old identity can sabotage their\nnew plans for change.\nBehind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a\ndemocracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social\nequality . The system of a dictatorship has a very dif ferent set of beliefs like\nabsolute authority and strict obedience. Y ou can imagine many ways to try\nto get more people to vote in a democracy , but such behavior change would\nnever get of f the ground in a dictatorship. That’ s not the identity of the\nsystem. V oting is a behavior that is impossible under a certain set of beliefs.\nA similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals,\norganizations, or societies. There are a set of beliefs and assumptions that\nshape the system, an identity behind the habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. Y ou may want\nmore money , but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than\ncreates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than\nearning. Y ou may want better health, but if you continue to prioritize\ncomfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than\ntraining. It’ s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying\nbeliefs that led to your past behavior . You have a new goal and a new plan,\nbut you haven’ t changed who you are.\nThe story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder , Colorado,\nprovides a good example. “For as long as I can remember , I’ve chewed my\nfingernails,” Clark told me. “It started as a nervous habit when I was young,\nand then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day , I resolved' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 33}page_content='to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful\nwillpower alone, I managed to do it.”\nThen, Clark did something surprising.\n“I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure,” he said. “My\nthought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn’ t chew\nthem. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was\nthe manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time. The\nmanicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really healthy ,\nattractive nails. Suddenly , I was proud of my fingernails. And even though\nthat’s something I had never aspired to, it made all the dif ference. I’ve\nnever chewed my nails since; not even a single close call. And it’ s because I\nnow take pride in properly caring for them.”\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part\nof your identity . It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants  this.\nIt’s something very dif ferent to say I’m the type of person who is this.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity , the more\nmotivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re\nproud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for\nand maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure\nyou never skip an upper -body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you\nknit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your\npride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.\nTrue behavior change is identity change. Y ou might start a habit because\nof motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes\npart of your identity . Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or\neat healthy once or twice, but if you don’ t shift the belief behind the\nbehavior , then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are\nonly temporary until they become part of who you are.\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become  a reader .\nThe goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become  a runner .\nThe goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become  a\nmusician.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 34}page_content='Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity . What you do is\nan indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either\nconsciously or nonconsciously . * Research has shown that once a person\nbelieves in a particular aspect of their identity , they are more likely to act in\nalignment with that belief. For example, people who identified as “being a\nvoter” were more likely to vote than those who simply claimed “voting”\nwas an action they wanted to perform. Similarly , the person who\nincorporates exercise into their identity doesn’ t have to convince\nthemselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy . After all, when your\nbehavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing\nbehavior change. Y ou are simply acting like the type of person you already\nbelieve yourself to be.\nLike all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword.\nWhen working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-\nimprovement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a\ncurse. Once you have adopted an identity , it can be easy to let your\nallegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through\nlife in a cognitive slumber , blindly following the norms attached to their\nidentity .\n“I’m terrible with directions.”\n“I’m not a morning person.”\n“I’m bad at remembering people’ s names.”\n“I’m always late.”\n“I’m not good with technology .”\n“I’m horrible at math.”\n. . . and a thousand other variations.\nWhen you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide\ninto these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to\nresist certain actions because “that’ s not who I am.” There is internal\npressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent\nwith your beliefs. Y ou find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting\nyourself.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 35}page_content='The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity , the more\ndifficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your\nculture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image\n(personal identity), even if it’ s wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change\nat any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits\ncan make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity , you will fail\nto put them into action.\nOn any given day , you may struggle with your habits because you’re too\nbusy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the\nlong run, however , the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your\nself-image gets in the way . This is why you can’ t get too attached to one\nversion of your identity . Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best\nversion of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to\nupgrade and expand your identity .\nThis brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview\nplay such an important role in your behavior , where do they come from in\nthe first place? How , exactly , is your identity formed? And how can you\nemphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase\nthe pieces that hinder you?\nTHE TWO-STEP PROCESS T O CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\nYour identity emer ges out of your habits. Y ou are not born with preset\nbeliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and\nconditioned through experience.  *\nMore precisely , your habits are how you embody  your identity . When\nyou make your bed each day , you embody the identity of an or ganized\nperson. When you write each day , you embody the identity of a creative\nperson. When you train each day , you embody the identity of an athletic\nperson.\nThe more you repeat a behavior , the more you reinforce the identity\nassociated with that behavior . In fact, the word identity  was originally\nderived from the Latin words essentitas  , which means being,  and identidem\n, which means r epeatedly  . Your identity is literally your “repeated\nbeingness.”' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 36}page_content='Whatever your identity is right now , you only believe it because you\nhave proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you\nhave evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour\nevery night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym\neven when it’ s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to\nfitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will\nbelieve it.\nFor most of my early life, I didn’ t consider myself a writer . If you were\nto ask any of my high school teachers or college professors, they would tell\nyou I was an average writer at best: certainly not a standout. When I began\nmy writing career , I published a new article every Monday and Thursday\nfor the first few years. As the evidence grew , so did my identity as a writer .\nI didn’ t start out as a writer . I became  one through my habits.\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your\nidentity , but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important\nones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’ s unlikely you\nwould consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or\nan artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions,\nhowever , the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.\nThe ef fect of one-of f experiences tends to fade away while the ef fect of\nhabits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most\nof the evidence that shapes your identity . In this way , the process of\nbuilding habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.\nThis is a gradual evolution. W e do not change by snapping our fingers\nand deciding to be someone entirely new . We change bit by bit, day by day ,\nhabit by habit. W e are continually under going microevolutions of the self.\nEach habit is like a suggestion: “Hey , maybe this is who I am.” If you\nfinish a book, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes reading. If\nyou go to the gym, then perhaps you are the type of person who likes\nexercise. If you practice playing the guitar , perhaps you are the type of\nperson who likes music.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to\nbecome. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes\nbuild up, so does the evidence of your new identity . This is one reason why\nmeaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make\na meaningful dif ference by providing evidence of a new identity . And if a' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 37}page_content='change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’ s the paradox of making small\nimprovements.\nPutting this all together , you can see that habits are the path to changing\nyour identity . The most practical way to change who you are is to change\nwhat  you do.\nEach time you write a page, you are a writer .\nEach time you practice the violin, you are a musician.\nEach time you start a workout, you are an athlete.\nEach time you encourage your employees, you are a leader .\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more\nimportant: to trust yourself. Y ou start to believe you can actually\naccomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins\nto change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.\nOf course, it works the opposite way , too. Every time you choose to\nperform a bad habit, it’ s a vote for that identity . The good news is that you\ndon’t need to be perfect. In any election, there are going to be votes for both\nsides. Y ou don’ t need a unanimous vote to win an election; you just need a\nmajority . It doesn’ t matter if you cast a few votes for a bad behavior or an\nunproductive habit. Y our goal is simply to win the majority of the time.\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes\nyou’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had.\nIf nothing changes, nothing is going to change.\nIt is a simple two-step process:\n1. Decide the type of person you want to be.\n2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nFirst, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an\nindividual, as a team, as a community , as a nation. What do you want to\nstand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to\nbecome?' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 38}page_content='These are big questions, and many people aren’ t sure where to begin—\nbut they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to\nfeel less anxious or to double their salary . That’ s fine. Start there and work\nbackward from the results you want to the type of person who could get\nthose results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the\noutcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds?\nWho is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type\nof person that could run a successful start-up?\nFor example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’ s\nprobably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts\nfrom writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is\nconsistent and reliable (identity-based).\nThis process can lead to beliefs like:\n“I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.”\n“I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy\nthey need.”\n“I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can\nbegin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity . I have a friend\nwho lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person\ndo?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. W ould a healthy\nperson walk or take a cab? W ould a healthy person order a burrito or a\nsalad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough,\neventually she would become that person. She was right.\nThe concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another\nkey theme in this book: feedback loops. Y our habits shape your identity ,\nand your identity shapes your habits. It’ s a two-way street. The formation of\nall habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next\nchapter), but it’ s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive\nthe loop rather than your results.

But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of\nperson you want to become?” The first step is not what  or how , but who .\nYou need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is\nlike a boat without a rudder . And that’ s why we are starting here.\nYou have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Y our identity\nis not set in stone. Y ou have a choice in every moment. Y ou can choose the\nidentity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today .

It’ s\nnot about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each\nmorning or wearing the same outfit each day . It’s not about achieving\nexternal measures of success like earning more money , losing weight, or\nreducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but\nfundamentally they are not about having  something. They are about\nbecoming  someone.\nUltimately , your habits matter because they help you become the type of\nperson you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop\nyour deepest beliefs about yourself.

Thorndike was interested\nin studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.\nHe would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box\nwas designed so that the cat could escape through a door “  by some simple\nact, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever , or stepping on a\nplatform.” For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed,\nwould open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened,\nthe cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.\nMost cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box.\nThey would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through\nopenings, and claw at loose objects. After a few minutes of exploration, the\ncats would happen to press the magical lever , the door would open, and they\nwould escape.\nThorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the\nbeginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the\nlever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began.\nGradually , each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with\nthe reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.\nAfter twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and\nhabitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example,' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 42}page_content='Thorndike noted, “Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act. 160\nseconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 1 1, 15, 20, 12, 10,\n14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7.”\nDuring the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes.\nDuring the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. W ith\npractice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and\nmore automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut\nstraight to the solution.\nFrom his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “\nbehaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and\nthose that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”\nHis work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form\nin our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions\nlike: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?\nWHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS\nA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\nautomatic. The process of habit formation begins with trial and error .\nWhenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a\ndecision. How do I r espond to this?  The first time you come across a\nproblem, you’re not sure how to solve it. Like Thorndike’ s cat, you’re just\ntrying things out to see what works.\nNeurological activity in the brain is high during this period. Y ou are\ncarefully analyzing the situation and making conscious decisions about how\nto act. Y ou’re taking in tons of new information and trying to make sense of\nit all. The brain is busy learning the most ef fective course of action.\nOccasionally , like a cat pressing on a lever , you stumble across a\nsolution. Y ou’re feeling anxious, and you discover that going for a run\ncalms you down. Y ou’re mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and\nyou learn that playing video games relaxes you. Y ou’re exploring,\nexploring, exploring, and then—BAM—a reward.\nAfter you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy\nfor next time. Y our brain immediately begins to catalog the events that' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 43}page_content='preceded the reward. Wait a minute—that felt good. What did I do right\nbefor e that?\nThis is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try , fail, learn, try\ndifferently . With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful\nactions get reinforced. That’ s a habit forming.\nWhenever you face a problem repeatedly , your brain begins to automate\nthe process of solving it. Y our habits are just a series of automatic solutions\nthat solve the problems and stresses you face regularly . As behavioral\nscientist Jason Hreha writes, “  Habits are, simply , reliable solutions to\nrecurring problems in our environment.”\nAs habits are created, the level of activity in the brain decreases  . You\nlearn to lock in on the cues that predict success and tune out everything\nelse. When a similar situation arises in the future, you know exactly what to\nlook for . There is no longer a need to analyze every angle of a situation.\nYour brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if\nthis, then that. These cognitive scripts can be followed automatically\nwhenever the situation is appropriate. Now , whenever you feel stressed, you\nget the itch to run. As soon as you walk in the door from work, you grab the\nvideo game controller . A choice that once required ef fort is now automatic.\nA habit has been created.\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit\nis just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in\nthe past. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory\nand automatically apply the same solution. The primary reason the brain\nremembers the past is to better predict what will work in the future.\nHabit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the\nbottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time.\nAs a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious\nattention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the\nconscious mind likes to pawn of f tasks to the nonconscious mind to do\nautomatically . This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed.\nHabits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity , so you can\nallocate your attention to other tasks.\nDespite their ef ficiency , some people still wonder about the benefits of\nhabits. The ar gument goes like this: “W ill habits make my life dull? I don’ t\nwant to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’ t enjoy . Doesn’ t so much' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 44}page_content='routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly . Such\nquestions set up a false dichotomy . They make you think that you have to\nchoose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality , the two\ncomplement each other .\nHabits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who\ndon’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least  amount of\nfreedom. W ithout good financial habits, you will always be struggling for\nthe next dollar . Without good health habits, you will always seem to be\nshort on ener gy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like\nyou’re behind the curve. If you’re always being forced to make decisions\nabout simple tasks—when should I work out, where do I go to write, when\ndo I pay the bills—then you have less time for freedom. It’ s only by making\nthe fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed\nfor free thinking and creativity .\nConversely , when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life\nare handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and\nmaster the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to\ndo more of what you want in the future.\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK\nThe process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue,\ncraving, response, and reward.  * Breaking it down into these fundamental\nparts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to\nimprove it.\nFIGURE 5:  All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue,\ncraving, response, and reward.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 45}page_content='This four -step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs\nthrough these steps in the same order each time.\nFirst, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior .\nIt is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Our prehistoric ancestors\nwere paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards\nlike food, water , and sex. T oday , we spend most of our time learning cues\nthat predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status,\npraise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction.\n(Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and\nreproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.)\nYour mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external\nenvironment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the\nfirst indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.\nCravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind\nevery habit. W ithout some level of motivation or desire—without craving a\nchange—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but\nthe change in state it delivers. Y ou do not crave smoking a cigarette, you\ncrave the feeling of relief it provides. Y ou are not motivated by brushing\nyour teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. Y ou do not want to\nturn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to\na desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will\ndiscuss in detail later .\nCravings dif fer from person to person. In theory , any piece of\ninformation could trigger a craving, but in practice, people are not\nmotivated by the same cues. For a gambler , the sound of slot machines can\nbe a potent trigger that sparks an intense wave of desire. For someone who\nrarely gambles, the jingles and chimes of the casino are just background\nnoise. Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts,\nfeelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a\ncraving.\nThe third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you\nperform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a\nresponse occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction\nis associated with the behavior . If a particular action requires more physical\nor mental ef fort than you are willing to expend, then you won’ t do it. Y our\nresponse also depends on your ability . It sounds simple, but a habit can' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 46}page_content='occur only if you are capable of doing it. If you want to dunk a basketball\nbut can’ t jump high enough to reach the hoop, well, you’re out of luck.\nFinally , the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of\nevery habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about\nwanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. W e chase\nrewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they\nteach us.\nThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving  . Yes, rewards\nprovide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the ener gy you need\nto survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in\nshape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more\nimmediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain\nstatus or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver\ncontentment and relief from craving.\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the\nfuture. Y our brain is a reward detector . As you go about your life, your\nsensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy\nyour desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment\nare part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful\nactions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete\nthe habit cycle.\nIf a behavior is insuf ficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a\nhabit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving\nand you won’ t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior\ndifficult and you won’ t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy\nyour desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. W ithout\nthe first three steps, a behavior will not occur . Without all four , a behavior\nwill not be repeated.\nTHE HABIT LOOP' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 47}page_content='FIGURE 6:  The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They\nform an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit\nloop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next,\ntrying out dif ferent responses, and learning from the results.  *\nIn summary , the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response,\nwhich provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately ,\nbecomes associated with the cue. T ogether , these four steps form a\nneurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving,\nresponse, reward—that ultimately allows you to create automatic habits.\nThis cycle is known as the habit loop.\nThis four -step process is not something that happens occasionally , but\nrather it is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every\nmoment you are alive—even now . The brain is continually scanning the\nenvironment, predicting what will happen next, trying out dif ferent\nresponses, and learning from the results. The entire process is completed in\na split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything\nthat has been packed into the previous moment.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 48}page_content='We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the\nsolution phase.

Sometimes the\nproblem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.\nSometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to\nrelieve it.

Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we\ntie the same shoe first each morning, or unplug the toaster after each use, or\nalways change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After\ndecades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns\nof thinking and acting.\nTHE FOUR LA WS OF BEHA VIOR CHANGE\nIn the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four stages of\ncue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each\nday. But before we do that, we need to transform these four steps into a\npractical framework that we can use to design good habits and eliminate\nbad ones.\nI refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change  , and it\nprovides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad\nones. Y ou can think of each law as a lever that influences human behavior .\nWhen the levers are in the right positions, creating good habits is ef fortless.\nWhen they are in the wrong positions, it is nearly impossible.\nHow to Cr eate a Good Habit\nThe 1st law (Cue):  Make it obvious.\nThe 2nd law (Craving):  Make it attractive.\nThe 3rd law (Response):  Make it easy .\nThe 4th law (Reward):  Make it satisfying.\nWe can invert these laws to learn how to break a bad habit.\nHow to Br eak a Bad Habit\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue):  Make it invisible.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 51}page_content='Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving):  Make it unattractive.\nInversion of the 3rd law (Response):  Make it dif ficult.\nInversion of the 4th law (Reward):  Make it unsatisfying.\nIt would be irresponsible for me to claim that these four laws are an\nexhaustive framework for changing any human behavior , but I think they’re\nclose. As you will soon see, the Four Laws of Behavior Change apply to\nnearly every field, from sports to politics, art to medicine, comedy to\nmanagement. These laws can be used no matter what challenge you are\nfacing. There is no need for completely dif ferent strategies for each habit.\nWhenever you want to change your behavior , you can simply ask\nyourself:\n1. How can I make it obvious?\n2. How can I make it attractive?\n3. How can I make it easy?\n4. How can I make it satisfying?\nIf you have ever wondered, “Why don’ t I do what I say I’m going to do?\nWhy don’ t I lose the weight or stop smoking or save for retirement or start\nthat side business? Why do I say something is important but never seem to\nmake time for it?” The answers to those questions can be found somewhere\nin these four laws. The key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is\nto understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your\nspecifications. Every goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of\nhuman nature.\nYour habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters that\nfollow , we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can use\nthem to create a system in which good habits emer ge naturally and bad\nhabits wither away .\nChapter Summary' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 52}page_content='A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become\nautomatic.\nThe ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as\nlittle ener gy and ef fort as possible.\nAny habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four\nsteps: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nThe Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can\nuse to build better habits.

She had spent years working as a\nparamedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father -in-\nlaw and got very concerned.\n“I don’ t like the way you look,” she said.\nHer father -in-law , who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,\n“Well, I don’ t like your looks, either .”\n“No,” she insisted. “Y ou need to go to the hospital now .”\nA few hours later , the man was under going lifesaving sur gery after an\nexamination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was\nat immediate risk of a heart attack. W ithout his daughter -in-law’ s intuition,\nhe could have died.\nWhat did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart\nattack?\nWhen major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood\nto critical or gans and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the\nskin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the\nface. After many years of working with people with heart failure, the\nwoman had unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on\nsight. She couldn’ t explain what it was that she noticed in her father -in-\nlaw’s face, but she knew something was wrong.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 55}page_content='Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts can\nidentify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and which one is a\nplane from their own fleet even though they are traveling at the same speed,\nflying at the same altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly every\nrespect. During the Gulf W ar, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved\nan entire battleship when he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact\nthat it looked exactly like the battleship’ s own planes on radar . He made the\nright call, but even his superior of ficers couldn’ t explain how he did it.\nMuseum curators have been known to discern the dif ference between an\nauthentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they\ncan’t tell you precisely which details tipped them of f. Experienced\nradiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will\ndevelop before any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye. I’ve even\nheard of hairdressers noticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the\nfeel of her hair .\nThe human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in\nyour surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.\nWhenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing\nthe face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a\nradar screen—your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through\nthe details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that\ninformation for future use.\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain\noutcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically , your brain\nencodes the lessons learned through experience. W e can’ t always explain\nwhat it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way , and\nyour ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation\nfor every habit you have.\nWe underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without\nthinking. Y ou do not tell your hair to grow , your heart to pump, your lungs\nto breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this\nand more on autopilot. Y ou are much more than your conscious self.\nConsider hunger . How do you know when you’re hungry? Y ou don’ t\nnecessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to\neat.

Cravings\ncan arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating through your body .\nSuddenly , you’re hungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you\noff.\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’ t\nneed to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. Y ou can notice an\nopportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it.\nThis is what makes habits useful.\nIt’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come\nunder the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. Y ou fall into\nold patterns before you realize what’ s happening. Unless someone points it\nout, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand\nwhenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a question, or that\nyou have a habit of finishing other people’ s sentences. And the more you\nrepeat these patterns, the less likely you become to question what you’re\ndoing and why you’re doing it.\nI once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift\ncards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day , the\nclerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift cards.\nWhen the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer ’s actual\ncredit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in half—entirely on\nautopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer and realizing what\nhad just happened.\nAnother woman I came across in my research was a former preschool\nteacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now\nworking with adults, her old habits would kick in and she kept asking\ncoworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the bathroom.

Our responses to these cues are\nso deeply encoded that it may feel like the ur ge to act comes from nowhere.\nFor this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with\nawareness.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 57}page_content='Before we can ef fectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on\nour current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once\na habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and\nautomatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’ t expect to improve it. As\nthe psychologist Carl Jung said, “  Until you make the unconscious\nconscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”\nTHE HABITS SCORECARD\nThe Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If\nyou ever find yourself riding a train in T okyo, you’ll notice that the\nconductors have a peculiar habit.\nAs each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing\nat dif ferent objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a\nsignal, the operator will point at it and say , “Signal is green.” As the train\npulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer\nand call out the exact speed. When it’ s time to leave, the operator will point\nat the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are\nperforming similar actions. Before each train departs, staf f members will\npoint along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is\nidentified, pointed at, and named aloud.  *\nThis process, known as Pointing-and-Calling  , is a safety system\ndesigned to reduce mistakes. It seems silly , but it works incredibly well.\nPointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents\nby 30 percent. The MT A subway system in New Y ork City adopted a\nmodified version that is “point-only ,” and “within two years of\nimplementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.”\nPointing-and-Calling is so ef fective because it raises the level of\nawareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because\nthe train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are\nmore likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.\nMy wife does something similar . Whenever we are preparing to walk out\nthe door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her\npacking list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses.\nI’ve got my husband.”' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 58}page_content='The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to\nconsciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand\ntimes before, we begin to overlook things. W e assume that the next time\nwill be just like the last. W e’re so used to doing what we’ve always done\nthat we don’ t stop to question whether it’ s the right thing to do at all. Many\nof our failures in performance are lar gely attributable to a lack of self-\nawareness.\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining\nawareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the\nconsequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. W e need a “point-and-call”\nsystem for our personal lives. That’ s the origin of the Habits Scorecard,\nwhich is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your\nbehavior . To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.\nHere’ s a sample of where your list might start:\nWake up\nTurn of f alarm\nCheck my phone\nGo to the bathroom\nWeigh myself\nTake a shower\nBrush my teeth\nFloss my teeth\nPut on deodorant\nHang up towel to dry\nGet dressed\nMake a cup of tea\n. . . and so on.\nOnce you have a full list, look at each behavior , and ask yourself, “Is this\na good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+”\nnext to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.\nFor example, the list above might look like this:\nWake up =' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 59}page_content='Turn of f alarm =\nCheck my phone –\nGo to the bathroom =\nWeigh myself +\nTake a shower +\nBrush my teeth +\nFloss my teeth +\nPut on deodorant +\nHang up towel to dry =\nGet dressed =\nMake a cup of tea +\nThe marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation\nand your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight, eating a bagel\nwith peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit. For someone who is\ntrying to bulk up and add muscle, the same behavior might be a good habit.\nIt all depends on what you’re working toward.  *\nScoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as\nwell. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There\nare no good habits or bad habits. There are only ef fective habits. That is,\neffective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the\nbad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise, categorize your\nhabits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Generally speaking,\ngood habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative\noutcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce stress right now (that’ s how it’ s\nserving you), but it’ s not a healthy long-term behavior .\nIf you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit,\nhere is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the\ntype of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my\ndesired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually\ngood. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.\nAs you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change\nanything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.\nObserve your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 60}page_content='Don’ t blame yourself for your faults.

If you waste time online, notice that you are\nspending your life in a way that you do not want to.\nThe first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If\nyou feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in\nyour own life. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and\nwhat the outcome will be. If you want to cut back on your junk food habit\nbut notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat\nthis cookie, but I don’ t need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and\nhurt my health.”\nHearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem\nmore real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself\nmindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re\nsimply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just saying out loud,\n“Tomorrow , I need to go to the post of fice after lunch,” increases the odds\nthat you’ll actually do it.

The subjects\nwere divided into three groups.\nThe first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track\nhow often they exercised.\nThe second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not\nonly to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits\nof exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could\nreduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health.\nFinally , there was the third group. These subjects received the same\npresentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels\nof motivation. However , they were also asked to formulate a plan for when\nand where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically , each\nmember of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the\nnext week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on\n[DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”\nIn the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at\nleast once per week. (Interestingly , the motivational presentation given to\nthe second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior .) But\n91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than\ndouble the normal rate.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 63}page_content='The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an\nimplementation intention  , which is a plan you make beforehand about\nwhen and where to act. That is, how you intend  to implement  a particular\nhabit.\nThe cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel\nof your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies,\nthe sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time\nand location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.\nBroadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation\nintention is:\n“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y .”\nHundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are\neffective for sticking to our goals, whether it’ s writing down the exact time\nand date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your\ncolonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will stick\nwith habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early , and stopping\nsmoking.\nResearchers have even found that voter turnout increases when people\nare forced to create implementation intentions by answering questions like:\n“What route are you taking to the polling station? At what time are you\nplanning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other successful government\nprograms have prompted citizens to make a clear plan to send taxes in on\ntime or provided directions on when and where to pay late traf fic bills.\nThe punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and\nwhere they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. T oo\nmany people try to change their habits without these basic details figured\nout. W e tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write\nmore,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen.\nWe leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or\nfeel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away\nfoggy notions like “I want to work out more” or “I want to be more\nproductive” or “I should vote” and transforms them into a concrete plan of\naction.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 64}page_content='Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is\nclarity . It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some\npeople spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an\nimprovement.\nOnce an implementation intention has been set, you don’ t have to wait\nfor inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate\nthis morning or at lunch?  When the moment of action occurs, there is no\nneed to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\nThe simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out\nthis sentence:\nI will [BEHA VIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCA TION].\nMeditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.\nStudying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my\nbedroom.\nExercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.\nMarriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.\nIf you aren’ t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week,\nmonth, or year . People are more likely to take action at those times because\nhope is usually higher . If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A\nfresh start feels motivating.\nThere is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific\nabout what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things\nthat derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you of f course. W e\noften say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what\nwe need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’ s easy to\nrationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific\nthings you need to do to succeed.\nGive your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to\nmake the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get\nan ur ge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’ t say why . As\nthe writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 65}page_content='out without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe\nyou start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”\nThere are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life and\nwork. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ\nFogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking  .\nHABIT ST ACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN T O OVERHAUL YOUR\nHABITS\nThe French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty ,\nbut that all changed one day in 1765.\nDiderot’ s daughter was about to be married and he could not af ford to\npay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known\nfor his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie  , one of the most\ncomprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the\nEmpress of Russia, heard of Diderot’ s financial troubles, her heart went out\nto him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She\noffered to buy Diderot’ s personal library for £1,000—more than $150,000\ntoday . * Suddenly , Diderot had money to spare. W ith his new wealth, he not\nonly paid for the wedding but also acquired a scarlet robe for himself.\nDiderot’ s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he\nimmediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his\nmore common possessions. He wrote that there was “  no more coordination,\nno more unity , no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his\nstuff.\nDiderot soon felt the ur ge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his\nrug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive\nsculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better\nkitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like\nfalling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.\nDiderot’ s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one\npurchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Ef fect. The Diderot\nEffect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of\nconsumption that leads to additional purchases.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 66}page_content='You can spot this pattern everywhere. Y ou buy a dress and have to get\nnew shoes and earrings to match. Y ou buy a couch and suddenly question\nthe layout of your entire living room. Y ou buy a toy for your child and soon\nfind yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It’ s a chain\nreaction of purchases.\nMany human behaviors follow this cycle. Y ou often decide what to do\nnext based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom\nleads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need\nto put the dirty towels in the laundry , so you add laundry deter gent to the\nshopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action\nbecomes a cue that triggers the next behavior .\nWhy is this important?\nWhen it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of\nbehavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to\nidentify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new\nbehavior on top. This is called habit stacking  .\nHabit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather\nthan pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it\nwith a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of\nhis T iny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly\nany habit.  *\nThe habit stacking formula is:\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\nFor example:\nMeditation. After I pour my cup of cof fee each morning, I will\nmeditate for one minute.\nExercise. After I take of f my work shoes, I will immediately change\ninto my workout clothes.\nGratitude. After I sit down to dinner , I will say one thing I’m grateful\nfor that happened today .\nMarriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 67}page_content='Safety . After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family\nmember where I am running and how long it will take.\nThe key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do\neach day . Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to\ncreate lar ger stacks by chaining small habits together . This allows you to\ntake advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior\nleading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Ef fect.\nHABIT ST ACKING' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 68}page_content='FIGURE 7:  Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit\nby stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated\nto chain numerous habits together , each one acting as the cue for the next.\nYour morning routine habit stack might look like this:\n1. After I pour my morning cup of cof fee, I will meditate for sixty\nseconds.\n2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the\nday.\n3. After I write my to-do list for the day , I will immediately begin my\nfirst task.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 69}page_content='Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:\n1. After I finish eating dinner , I will put my plate directly into the\ndishwasher .\n2. After I put my dishes away , I will immediately wipe down the\ncounter .\n3. After I wipe down the counter , I will set out my cof fee mug for\ntomorrow morning.\nYou can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current\nroutines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that looks\nlike this: W ake up > Make my bed > T ake a shower . Let’ s say you want to\ndevelop the habit of reading more each night. Y ou can expand your habit\nstack and try something like: W ake up > Make my bed > Place a book on\nmy pillow  > Take a shower . Now , when you climb into bed each night, a\nbook will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy .\nOverall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that\nguide your future behavior . It’s like you always have a game plan for which\naction should come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you\ncan develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is\nappropriate:\nExercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using\nthe elevator .\nSocial skills. When I walk into a party , I will introduce myself to\nsomeone I don’ t know yet.\nFinances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait\ntwenty-four hours before purchasing.\nHealthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies\non my plate first.\nMinimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away . (“\nOne in, one out.”)\nMood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile\nbefore answering.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 70}page_content='Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and\nchairs to make sure I don’ t leave anything behind.\nNo matter how you use this strategy , the secret to creating a successful\nhabit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things of f. Unlike an\nimplementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for\na given behavior , habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built\ninto it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine\ncan make a big dif ference. If you’re trying to add meditation into your\nmorning routine but mornings are chaotic and your kids keep running into\nthe room, then that may be the wrong place and time. Consider when you\nare most likely to be successful. Don’ t ask yourself to do a habit when\nyou’re likely to be occupied with something else.\nYour cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If\nyou want to do a habit every day , but you stack it on top of a habit that only\nhappens on Mondays, that’ s not a good choice.\nOne way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming\na list of your current habits. Y ou can use your Habits Scorecard from the\nlast chapter as a starting point. Alternatively , you can create a list with two\ncolumns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without\nfail. *\nFor example:\nGet out of bed.\nTake a shower .\nBrush your teeth.\nGet dressed.\nBrew a cup of cof fee.\nEat breakfast.\nTake the kids to school.\nStart the work day .\nEat lunch.\nEnd the work day .\nChange out of work clothes.\nSit down for dinner .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 71}page_content='Turn of f the lights.\nGet into bed.\nYour list can be much longer , but you get the idea. In the second column,\nwrite down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For\nexample:\nThe sun rises.\nYou get a text message.\nThe song you are listening to ends.\nThe sun sets.\nArmed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to\nlayer your new habit into your lifestyle.\nHabit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and\nimmediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I made\nthis mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack\nwas “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance,\nthis sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear . Would\nI do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do\nthem? After a few inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I\nclose my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.”\nAmbiguity gone.\nHabits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals\ndo not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear:\nAfter I close the door . After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table.\nThe specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a\nspecific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time\ncomes to act.\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious.  Strategies like\nimplementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical\nways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for\nwhen and where to take action.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 72}page_content='Chapter Summary\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious  .\nThe two most common cues are time and location.\nCreating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair\na new habit with a specific time and location.\nThe implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHA VIOR] at\n[TIME] in [LOCA TION].\nHabit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a\ncurrent habit.\nThe habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will\n[NEW HABIT].' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 73}page_content='A\nAFTER\n6\nMotivation Is Overrated; Environment Often\nMatters More\nNNE THORNDIKE  , A primary care physician at Massachusetts General\nHospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve\nthe eating habits of thousands of hospital staf f and visitors without changing\ntheir willpower or motivation in the slightest way . In fact, she didn’ t plan on\ntalking to them at all.\nThorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the\n“choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing\nhow drinks were arranged in the room. Originally , the refrigerators located\nnext to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. The\nresearchers added water as an option to each one. Additionally , they placed\nbaskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda\nwas still in the primary refrigerators, but water was now available at all\ndrink locations.\nOver the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital\ndropped by 1 1.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by\n25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments—and saw similar results—\nwith the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating\nthere.\nBEFORE' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 74}page_content='FIGURE 8:  Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked like before the\nenvironment design changes were made (left) and after (right). The shaded boxes\nindicate areas where bottled water was available in each instance. Because the\namount of water in the environment was increased, behavior shifted naturally and\nwithout additional motivation.\nPeople often choose products not because of what  they are, but because\nof wher e they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on\nthe counter , I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’ t been\nthinking about them beforehand and didn’ t necessarily feel hungry . If the\ncommunal table at the of fice is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’ s\ngoing to be hard not to grab one every now and then. Y our habits change\ndepending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you.\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior . Despite\nour unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again\nunder certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in\nwhispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way , the\nmost common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed\nby the world around us. Every habit is context dependent.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 75}page_content='In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a\npowerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their\nEnvironment, or B = f (P,E).\nIt didn’ t take long for Lewin’ s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952,\nthe economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion\nImpulse Buying  , which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the\nfirst time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will\noccasionally buy products not because they want  them but because of how\nthey are presented  to them.\nFor example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those\ndown near the floor . For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand names\nfeatured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the\nmost profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder -to-reach\nspots. The same goes for end caps, which are the units at the end of aisles.\nEnd caps are moneymaking machines for retailers because they are obvious\nlocations that encounter a lot of foot traf fic. For example, 45 percent of\nCoca-Cola sales come specifically from end-of-the-aisle racks.\nThe more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely\nyou are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit\nStarbucks because it is on every corner . We like to think that we are in\ncontrol. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted\nto do so. The truth, however , is that many of the actions we take each day\nare shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious\noption.\nEvery living being has its own methods for sensing and understanding\nthe world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision. Snakes can smell\nby “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect\nsmall amounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by nearby\nfish. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny sensory cells that allow\nthem to detect toxic chemicals in their environment.\nIn humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. W e\nperceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also\nhave other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are\nnonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops\nbefore a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or\nwhen you fall of f balance while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 76}page_content='your body pick up on a wide range of internal stimuli, such as the amount\nof salt in your blood or the need to drink when thirsty .\nThe most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however , is vision.\nThe human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.\nApproximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts\nestimate that half of the brain’ s resources are used on vision. Given that we\nare more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it should come as no\nsurprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior . For this\nreason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you\ndo . As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in\nenvironments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of\nunproductive ones.\nThankfully , there is good news in this respect. Y ou don’ t have to be the\nvictim of your environment. Y ou can also be the architect of it.\nHOW T O DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS\nDuring the ener gy crisis and oil embar go of the 1970s, Dutch researchers\nbegan to pay close attention to the country’ s ener gy usage. In one suburb\nnear Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less\nenergy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of similar size and\ngetting electricity for the same price.\nIt turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical\nexcept for one feature: the location of the electrical meter . Some had one in\nthe basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway .\nAs you may guess, the homes with the meters located in the main hallway\nused less electricity . When their ener gy use was obvious and easy to track,\npeople changed their behavior .\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues\nthat stand out. Unfortunately , the environments where we live and work\noften make it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue\nto trigger the behavior . It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’ s tucked\naway in the closet. It’ s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the\ncorner of the guest room. It’ s easy not to take your vitamins when they are' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 77}page_content='out of sight in the pantry . When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or\nhidden, they are easy to ignore.\nBy comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention\ntoward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staf f at Schiphol\nAirport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the\ncenter of each urinal. Apparently , when men stepped up to the urinals, they\naimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim\nand significantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis\ndetermined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per\nyear.\nI’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to buy\napples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the\nrefrigerator , and for get all about them. By the time I remembered, the\napples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.\nEventually , I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I\nbought a lar ge display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen\ncounter . The next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out in\nthe open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few\napples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out of sight.\nHere are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the\ncues for your preferred habits more obvious:\nIf you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your\npill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter .\nIf you want to practice guitar more frequently , place your guitar stand\nin the middle of the living room.\nIf you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack\nof stationery on your desk.\nIf you want to drink more water , fill up a few water bottles each\nmorning and place them in common locations around the house.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big\npart of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have\nmultiple cues. Consider how many dif ferent ways a smoker could be' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 78}page_content='prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car , seeing a friend smoke,\nfeeling stressed at work, and so on.\nThe same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling\ntriggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll\nthink about your habit throughout the day . Make sure the best choice is the\nmost obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the\ncues for good habits are right in front of you.\nEnvironment design is powerful not only because it influences how we\nengage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in\na world others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where\nyou live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce\nyour exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to take\nback control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your\nworld and not merely the consumer of it.\nTHE CONTEXT IS THE CUE\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your\nhabits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire\ncontext  surrounding the behavior .\nFor example, many people drink more in social situations than they\nwould ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the\nwhole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at\nthe bar , seeing the beers on tap.\nWe mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the\nhome, the of fice, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain\nhabits and routines. Y ou establish a particular relationship with the objects\non your desk, the items on your kitchen counter , the things in your\nbedroom.\nOur behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our\nrelationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence\nof the environment on your behavior . Stop thinking about your environment\nas filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.\nThink in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one\nperson, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 79}page_content='someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats a bowl of\nice cream after work. Dif ferent people can have dif ferent memories—and\nthus dif ferent habits—associated with the same place.\nThe good news? Y ou can train yourself to link a particular habit with a\nparticular context.\nIn one study , scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when\nthey were tired. If they couldn’ t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a\ndifferent room until they became sleepy . Over time, subjects began to\nassociate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became\neasier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned\nthat sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not watching television, not\nstaring at the clock—was the only action that happened in that room.\nThe power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be\neasier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers\nand cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a\ndifferent cof fee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you\nseldom use—and create a new routine there.\nIt is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a\nnew habit in the face of competing cues. It can be dif ficult to go to bed\nearly if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to\nstudy in the living room without getting distracted if that’ s where you\nalways play video games. But when you step outside your normal\nenvironment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’ t battling\nold environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without\ninterruption.\nWant to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio,\nor a building with expansive architecture. T ake a break from the space\nwhere you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought\npatterns.\nTrying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your\nregular supermarket. T ry a new grocery store. Y ou may find it easier to\navoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’ t automatically know where it\nis located in the store.\nWhen you can’ t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine\nor rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study ,' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 80}page_content='exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One\nspace, one use.”\nWhen I started my career as an entrepreneur , I would often work from\nmy couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very dif ficult to\nstop working. There was no clear division between the end of work time\nand the beginning of personal time. W as the kitchen table my of fice or the\nspace where I ate meals? W as the couch where I relaxed or where I sent\nemails? Everything happened in the same place.\nA few years later , I could finally af ford to move to a home with a\nseparate room for my of fice. Suddenly , work was something that happened\n“in here” and personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was\neasier for me to turn of f the professional side of my brain when there was a\nclear dividing line between work life and home life. Each room had one\nprimary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The of fice was for working.\nWhenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another .\nWhen you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier\nones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern\ntechnology is both a strength and a weakness. Y ou can use your phone for\nall sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use\nyour phone to do nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one\ntask. Y ou want to be productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse\nsocial media, check email, and play video games whenever you open your\nphone. It’ s a mishmash of cues.\nYou may be thinking, “Y ou don’ t understand. I live in New Y ork City .\nMy apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple\nroles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity\nzones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. Y ou can do\nthe same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer\nonly for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social\nmedia and texting. Every habit should have a home.\nIf you can manage to stick with this strategy , each context will become\nassociated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under\npredictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you\nare sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space\ndesigned for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 81}page_content='that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and\npredictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an\nenvironment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Summary\nSmall changes in context can lead to lar ge changes in behavior over\ntime.\nEvery habit is initiated by a cue. W e are more likely to notice cues that\nstand out.\nMake the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.\nGradually , your habits become associated not with a single trigger but\nwith the entire context surrounding the behavior .

While visiting\nthe troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed\nthere were heroin addicts. Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of\nservice members in V ietnam had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent\nwere addicted—the problem was even worse than they had initially thought.\nThe discovery led to a flurry of activity in W ashington, including the\ncreation of the Special Action Of fice of Drug Abuse Prevention under\nPresident Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track\naddicted service members when they returned home.\nLee Robins was one of the researchers in char ge. In a finding that\ncompletely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that\nwhen soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of\nthem became re-addicted within a year , and just 12 percent relapsed within\nthree years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used\nheroin in V ietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.\nThis finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which\nconsidered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition.\nInstead, Robins revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if\nthere was a radical change in the environment. In V ietnam, soldiers spent\nall day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 83}page_content='were engulfed by the constant stress of war , they built friendships with\nfellow soldiers who were also heroin users, and they were thousands of\nmiles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he\nfound himself in an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context\nchanged, so did the habit.\nCompare this situation to that of a typical drug user . Someone becomes\naddicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean—which is\ndevoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then\nreturns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused\nthem to get addicted in the first place. It’ s no wonder that usually you see\nnumbers that are the exact opposite of those in the V ietnam study . Typically ,\n90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from\nrehab.\nThe V ietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about\nbad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy\nbehavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker , or an addict,\nyou’ve been told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—\nmaybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline\nwould solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture.\nRecent research, however , shows something dif ferent. When scientists\nanalyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out\nthose individuals aren’ t all that dif ferent from those who are struggling.\nInstead, “  disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way\nthat does not r equir e heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they\nspend less time in tempting situations.\nThe people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to\nuse it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’ t have to\nuse it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to\nsuccess, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a\nmore disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.\nThis counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand\nwhat happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been\nencoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation\narises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, T exas, started smoking,\nshe would often light up while riding horses with a friend. Eventually , she\nquit smoking and avoided it for years. She had also stopped riding. Decades' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 84}page_content='later, she hopped on a horse again and found herself craving a cigarette for\nthe first time in forever . The cues were still internalized; she just hadn’ t\nbeen exposed to them in a long time.\nOnce a habit has been encoded, the ur ge to act follows whenever the\nenvironmental cues reappear . This is one reason behavior change\ntechniques can backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss\npresentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result many people\nreturn to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures of\nblackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of anxiety , which drives\nmany people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not careful about cues, you\ncan cause the very behavior you want to stop.\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the\nfeelings they try to numb. Y ou feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you\neat junk food, you feel bad. W atching television makes you feel sluggish, so\nyou watch more television because you don’ t have the ener gy to do\nanything else. W orrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which\ncauses you to smoke to ease your anxiety , which makes your health even\nworse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’ s a downward spiral, a\nrunaway train of bad habits.\nResearchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an\nexternal trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you\nnotice  something, you begin to want  it. This process is happening all the\ntime—often without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing\naddicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the\nreward pathway in the brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the\nbrain to consciously register—the addicts couldn’ t even tell you what they\nhad seen—but they craved the drug all the same.\nHere’ s the punch line: Y ou can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to\nforget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your\nbrain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go\nunused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is\nan inef fective strategy . It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled\nwith interruptions. It takes too much ener gy. In the short-run, you can\nchoose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of\nthe environment that we live in. T o put it bluntly , I have never seen\nsomeone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 85}page_content='A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits of f at the source. One of\nthe most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the\ncue that causes it.\nIf you can’ t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another\nroom for a few hours.\nIf you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following\nsocial media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy .\nIf you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out\nof the bedroom.\nIf you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading\nreviews of the latest tech gear .\nIf you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it\nin a closet after each use.\nThis practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.

T o begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake\ncardboard beaks, just a head without a body . When the parents had flown\naway , he went over to the nest and of fered these dummy beaks to the\nchicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he assumed the baby birds\nwould reject them altogether .\nHowever , when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak,\nthey pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother . They had a\nclear preference for those red spots—as if they had been genetically\nprogrammed at birth. Soon T inber gen discovered that the bigger the red\nspot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually , he created a beak with three\nlarge red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went\ncrazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as if it was the\ngreatest beak they had ever seen.\nTinber gen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other\nanimals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 89}page_content='Occasionally , as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs will\nroll out and settle on the grass nearby . Whenever this happens, the goose\nwill waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it back into the\nnest.\nTinber gen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object,\nsuch as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the\nobject, the greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous ef fort\nto roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically\npecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive rule:\nWhen I see a r ound object nearby , I must r oll it back into the nest. The\nbigger the r ound object, the har der I should try to get it.\nIt’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for\nbehavior , and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it\nlights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as\nsupernormal stimuli  . A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of\nreality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—\nand it elicits a stronger response than usual.\nHumans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality . Junk\nfood, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy . After spending\nhundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild,\nthe human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar , and fat.\nSuch foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our\nancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’ t know where\nyour next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent\nstrategy for survival.\nToday , however , we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant,\nbut your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on\nsalt, sugar , and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving\npersists because the brain’ s reward centers have not changed for\napproximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on\nstretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.\nA primary goal of food science is to create products that are more\nattractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been\nenhanced in some way , if only with additional flavoring. Companies spend\nmillions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato\nchip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 90}page_content='dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth—a quality\nknown as orosensation  . French fries, for example, are a potent combination\n—golden brown and crunchy on the outside, light and smooth on the inside.\nOther processed foods enhance dynamic contrast  , which refers to items\nwith a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy . Imagine the\ngooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of\nan Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center . With natural, unprocessed\nfoods, you tend to experience the same sensations over and over— how’s\nthat seventeenth bite of kale taste?  After a few minutes, your brain loses\ninterest and you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in dynamic\ncontrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat\nmore.\nUltimately , such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss point”\nfor each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar , and fat that excites\nyour brain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is\nthat you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the\nhuman brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in\neating behavior and obesity , says, “  We’ve gotten too good at pushing our\nown buttons.”\nThe modern food industry , and the overeating habits it has spawned, is\njust one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive.\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-\nforming.\nLook around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality\nthat are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores\nfeature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social\nmedia delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever\nget in the of fice or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes\nat a rate that would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements\nare created with a combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and\nPhotoshopped edits—even the model doesn’ t look like the person in the\nfinal image. These are the supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They\nexaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go\nwild as a result, driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media\nhabits, porn habits, eating habits, and many others.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 91}page_content='If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more\nattractive than those of today . The trend is for rewards to become more\nconcentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more\nconcentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more\nconcentrated form of alcohol than beer . Video games are a more\nconcentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these\npleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. W e have the brains of our\nancestors but temptations they never had to face.\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur , then you\nneed to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law , our\ngoal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible\nto transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any\nhabit more enticing. T o do this, we must start by understanding what a\ncraving is and how it works.\nWe begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the\ndopamine spike.\nTHE DOP AMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP\nScientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a\nneurotransmitter called dopamine.  * The importance of dopamine became\napparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran\nan experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and\ndesire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers\nblocked the release of dopamine. T o the surprise of the scientists, the rats\nlost all will to live. They wouldn’ t eat. They wouldn’ t have sex. They didn’ t\ncrave anything. W ithin a few days, the animals died of thirst.\nIn follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-\nreleasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of\nsugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit\nup with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine\nwas blocked, they liked  the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’ t\nwant  it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without\ndopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 92}page_content='When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward\nsystem of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck\nspeed. In one study , mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time\nthey poked their nose in a box. W ithin minutes, the mice developed a\ncraving so strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred\ntimes per hour . (Humans are not so dif ferent: the average slot machine\nplayer will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour .)\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is\nhighly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games,\nbrowsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The\nsame can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food,\ndrinking water , having sex, and interacting socially .\nFor years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now\nwe know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including\nmotivation, learning and memory , punishment and aversion, and voluntary\nmovement.\nWhen it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released\nnot only when you experience  pleasure, but also when you anticipate  it.\nGambling addicts have a dopamine spike right befor e they place a bet, not\nafter they win. Cocaine addicts get a sur ge of dopamine when they see the\npowder , not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity\nwill be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And\nwhenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us\nto take action.\nInterestingly , the reward system that is activated in the brain when you\nreceive  a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate  a\nreward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel\nbetter than the attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas\nmorning can be better than opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming\nabout an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on\nvacation. Scientists refer to this as the dif ference between “wanting” and\n“liking.”\nTHE DOP AMINE SPIKE' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 93}page_content='' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 94}page_content='FIGURE 9:  Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward\nis experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine rises befor e\ntaking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling\nof desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once a habit is\nlearned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you\nalready expect the reward. However , if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do\nnot get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of\nthe dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D).\nFirst, the cue is identified and dopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a\nresponse is taken but the reward does not come as quickly as expected and\ndopamine begins to drop. Finally , when the reward comes a little later than you\nhad hoped, dopamine spikes again. It is as if the brain is saying, “See! I knew I\nwas right. Don’ t forget to repeat this action next time.”\nYour brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting  rewards\nthan for liking  them. The wanting centers in the brain are lar ge: the brain\nstem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal\nstriatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By\ncomparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller . They are often\nreferred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are distributed like tiny islands\nthroughout the brain. For instance, researchers have found that 100 percent\nof the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10\npercent of the structure is activated during liking.\nThe fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions\nresponsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial\nrole these processes play . Desire is the engine that drives behavior . Every\naction is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving\nthat leads to the response.\nThese insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior\nChange. W e need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation\nof a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is\nwhere a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play .\nHOW T O USE TEMPT ATION BUNDLING T O MAKE YOUR\nHABITS MORE A TTRACTIVE\nRonan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed\nwatching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more often than' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 95}page_content='he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary\nbike and connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a\ncomputer program that would allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at\na certain speed. If he slowed down for too long, whatever show he was\nwatching would pause until he started pedaling again. He was, in the words\nof one fan, “  eliminating obesity one Netflix binge at a time.”\nHe was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit\nmore attractive. T emptation bundling works by linking an action you want\nto do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’ s case, he bundled watching\nNetflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing\nhe needed to do).\nBusinesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the\nAmerican Broadcasting Company , more commonly known as ABC,\nlaunched its Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season,\nthey promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.\nEvery Thursday , the company would air three shows created by\nscreenwriter Shonda Rhimes— Grey’s Anatomy  , Scandal  , and How to Get\nAway with Mur der . They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for\nThank God It’ s Thursday). In addition to promoting the shows, ABC\nencouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and enjoy the\nevening.\nAndrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind\nthe campaign: “  We see Thursday night as a viewership opportunity , with\neither couples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape\nand have fun and drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The\nbrilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed\nviewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already\nwanted  to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn).\nOver time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed\nand entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every\nThursday , then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means  relaxation and\nentertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of\nturning on the television becomes more attractive.\nYou’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of\nyour favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the\nlatest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 96}page_content='bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the\ngym. Maybe you want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean out your\nemail inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while processing overdue work\nemails.\nTemptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as\nPremack’ s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the\nprinciple states that “  more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable\nbehaviors.” In other words, even if you don’ t really want to process overdue\nwork emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do\nsomething you really want to do along the way .\nYou can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking\nstrategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your\nbehavior .\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:\n1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].\n2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I W ANT].\nIf you want to read the news, but you need to express more gratitude:\n1. After I get my morning cof fee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for\nthat happened yesterday (need).\n2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for , I will read the news (want).\nIf you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:\n1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential\nclients (need).\n2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).\nIf you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 97}page_content='1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).\n2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).\nThe hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or\ndoing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or\ncheck Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the\nthing you want to do.\nWe began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are\nheightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.\nTemptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit\nby connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a truly\nirresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can be employed to\nmake nearly any habit more attractive than it would be otherwise.\nChapter Summary\nThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.\nThe more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become\nhabit-forming.\nHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so\ndoes our motivation to act.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets\nus to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the\ndopamine spike.\nTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.\nThe strategy is to pair an action you want  to do with an action you\nneed  to do.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 98}page_content='I\n9\nThe Role of Family and Friends in Shaping\nYour Habits\nN 1965 , a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of strange\nletters to a woman named Klara.\nLaszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he believed in:\nhe completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with\ndeliberate practice and the development of good habits, a child could\nbecome a genius in any field. His mantra was “  A genius is not born, but is\neducated and trained.”\nLaszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his\nown children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a wife\nwilling to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she may not\nhave been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper\ninstruction, anyone could advance their skills.\nLaszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he\nlaid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids\nwould be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would\nbe filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The\nchildren would play against each other constantly and compete in the best\ntournaments they could find. The family would keep a meticulous file\nsystem of the tournament history of every competitor the children faced.\nTheir lives would be dedicated to chess.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 99}page_content='Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars\nwere parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.\nSusan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.\nWithin six months, she was defeating adults.\nSofia, the middle child, did even better . By fourteen, she was a world\nchampion, and a few years later , she became a grandmaster .\nJudit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her\nfather . At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one\nhundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four months old,\nshe became the youngest grandmaster of all time—younger than Bobby\nFischer , the previous record holder . For twenty-seven years, she was the\nnumber -one-ranked female chess player in the world.\nThe childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least. And\nyet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was attractive, even\nenjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as\nentertaining rather than grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’ t\nget enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found Sofia playing chess in the\nbathroom in the middle of the night. Encouraging her to go back to sleep,\nhe said, “Sofia, leave the pieces alone!” T o which she replied, “Daddy , they\nwon’ t leave me alone!”\nThe Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all\nelse—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession\nwith chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are\nnormal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.\nTHE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS\nHumans are herd animals. W e want to fit in, to bond with others, and to\nearn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to\nour survival. For most of our evolutionary history , our ancestors lived in\ntribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a\ndeath sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”  *\nMeanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed\nincreased safety , mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles\nDarwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 100}page_content='collaborate and improvise most ef fectively have prevailed.” As a result, one\nof the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference\nexerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior .\nWe don’ t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. W e follow the\nscript handed down by our friends and family , our church or school, our\nlocal community and society at lar ge. Each of these cultures and groups\ncomes with its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to\nget married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how\nmuch money to spend on your child’ s birthday party . In many ways, these\nsocial norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day .\nYou’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your\nmind. Often, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without\nquestioning, and sometimes without remembering. As the French\nphilosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life\nin society sweep us along.”\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden.\nEveryone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that rewards you for\nyour chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do.\nIf you work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be\ninclined to splur ge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside\njoke or using a new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you\n“get it.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\n1. The close.\n2. The many .\n3. The powerful.\nEach group of fers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior\nChange and make our habits more attractive.\n1. Imitating the Close' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 101}page_content='Proximity has a powerful ef fect on our behavior . This is true of the physical\nenvironment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the social\nenvironment.\nWe pick up habits from the people around us. W e copy the way our\nparents handle ar guments, the way our peers flirt with one another , the way\nour coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try ,\ntoo. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked\nbefore going to bed, you pick it up as well.\nI find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without\nrealizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of\nthe other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates. When\ntraveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite\nreminding myself to stop.\nAs a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are\nto imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked twelve\nthousand people for thirty-two years and found that “  a person’ s chances of\nbecoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who\nbecame obese.” It works the other way , too. Another study found that if one\nperson in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim down\nabout one third of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of\ninvisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.\nOf course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad\ninfluences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT ,\nhe took a small robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four became\nastronauts. If your goal was to make it into space, then that room was about\nthe best culture you could ask for . Similarly , one study found that the higher\nyour best friend’ s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be\nat age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence. W e\nsoak up the qualities and practices of those around us.\nOne of the most ef fective things you can do to build better habits is to\njoin a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior . New\nhabits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day . If you\nare surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to\nbe a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely\nto believe it’ s reasonable to play jazz every day . Your culture sets your' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 102}page_content='expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself with people who have\nthe habits you want to have yourself. Y ou’ll rise together .\nTo make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one\nstep further .\nJoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior\nand (2) you already have something in common with the group. Steve\nKamb, an entrepreneur in New Y ork City , runs a company called Nerd\nFitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight, get strong,\nand get healthy .” His clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and\naverage Joes who want to get in shape. Many people feel out of place the\nfirst time they go to the gym or try to change their diet, but if you are\nalready similar to the other members of the group in some way—say , your\nmutual love of Star W ars —change becomes more appealing because it\nfeels like something people like you already do.\nNothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It\ntransforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously , you were on your\nown. Y our identity was singular . You ar e a reader . You ar e a musician. Y ou\nare an athlete.  When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group,\nyour identity becomes linked to those around you. Growth and change is no\nlonger an individual pursuit. We are readers. W e are musicians. W e are\ncyclists.  The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity . This\nis why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to\nmaintaining your habits. It’ s friendship and community that embed a new\nidentity and help behaviors last over the long run.\n2. Imitating the Many\nIn the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of experiments\nthat are now taught to legions of under grads each year . To begin each\nexperiment, the subject entered the room with a group of strangers.\nUnbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors planted by the\nresearcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to certain questions.\nThe group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second\ncard with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 103}page_content='second card that was similar in length to the line on the first card. It was a\nvery simple task. Here is an example of two cards used in the experiment:\nCONFORMING T O SOCIAL NORMS\nFIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch in his\nfamous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the first card\n(left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actors claimed it was a\ndifferent length the research subjects would often change their minds and go with\nthe crowd rather than believe their own eyes.\nThe experiment always began the same. First, there would be some easy\ntrials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the\nparticipants were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones,\nexcept the actors in the room would select an intentionally incorr ect answer .\nFor example, they would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 104}page_content='10. Everyone would agree that the lines were the same even though they\nwere clearly dif ferent.\nThe subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become\nbewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh nervously to\nthemselves. They would double-check the reactions of other participants.\nTheir agitation would grow as one person after another delivered the same\nincorrect response. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes.\nEventually , they delivered the answer they knew in their heart to be\nincorrect.\nAsch ran this experiment many times and in many dif ferent ways. What\nhe discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the\nconformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor , then there\nwas no ef fect on the person’ s choice. They just assumed they were in the\nroom with a dummy . When two actors were in the room with the subject,\nthere was still little impact. But as the number of people increased to three\nactors and four and all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to\nsecond-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent\nof the subjects had agreed with the group answer even though it was\nobviously incorrect.\nWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our\nbehavior . We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering,\n“What is everyone else doing?” W e check reviews on Amazon or Y elp or\nTripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and\ntravel habits. It’ s usually a smart strategy . There is evidence in numbers.\nBut there can be a downside.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior\nof the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee\nlearns an ef fective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and\nthen switches to a new group that uses a less ef fective strategy , it will avoid\nusing the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the\nchimps.\nHumans are similar . There is tremendous internal pressure to comply\nwith the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater\nthan the reward of winning an ar gument, looking smart, or finding truth.\nMost days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 105}page_content='The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants  to get\nalong with others. This is our natural mode. Y ou can override it—you can\nchoose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it\ntakes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra ef fort.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is\nunattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe,\nchange is very attractive.\n3. Imitating the Powerful\nHumans everywhere pursue power , prestige, and status. W e want pins and\nmedallions on our jackets. W e want President or Partner in our titles. W e\nwant to be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can seem\nvain, but overall, it’ s a smart move. Historically , a person with greater\npower and status has access to more resources, worries less about survival,\nand proves to be a more attractive mate.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration,\nand status. W e want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the\nmusician who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the\nmost accomplished children because these things separate us from the\ncrowd. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.\nThis is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly ef fective\npeople. W e try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire\nsuccess ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we\nadmire. Y ou replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful firms\nin your industry . You make a recipe from your favorite baker . You borrow\nthe storytelling strategies of your favorite writer . You mimic the\ncommunication style of your boss. W e imitate people we envy .\nHigh-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And\nthat means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it\nattractive.\nWe are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status.\nWe trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’ t want to be the slob\nof the neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the\nhouse because we don’ t want to be judged. W e are continually wondering' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 106}page_content='“What will others think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the\nanswer .\nThe Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of\nthis chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social\ninfluences can have on our behavior . The sisters practiced chess for many\nhours each day and continued this remarkable ef fort for decades. But these\nhabits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they\nwere valued by their culture. From the praise of their parents to the\nachievement of dif ferent status markers like becoming a grandmaster , they\nhad many reasons to continue their ef fort.\nChapter Summary\nThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.\nWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture\nbecause we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.\nWe tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family\nand friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status\nand prestige).\nOne of the most ef fective things you can do to build better habits is to\njoin a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior\nand (2) you already have something in common with the group.\nThe normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired\nbehavior of the individual.

I was in the middle of a\nfour-day trip to T urkey and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out\narmchair a few feet away .\nMike wasn’ t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had been\nliving in T urkey for five years, but he of fered to show me around while I\nwas visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this particular night, I\nhad been invited to dinner with him and a handful of his T urkish friends.\nThere were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’ t, at some\npoint, smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day . I asked one of the\nTurks how he got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your\nfriends. One friend smokes, then you try it.”\nWhat was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room had\nmanaged to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few years at that\npoint, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit because of a book\ncalled Allen Carr ’s Easy W ay to Stop Smoking  .\n“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells you:\n‘Stop lying to yourself. Y ou know you don’ t actually want to smoke. Y ou\nknow you don’ t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the\nvictim anymore. Y ou start to realize that you don’ t need  to smoke.”' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 108}page_content='I had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book afterward out\nof curiosity . The author employs an interesting strategy to help smokers\neliminate their cravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated\nwith smoking and gives it a new meaning.\nHe says things like:\nYou think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything\nbecause cigarettes do nothing for you.\nYou think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’ s\nnot. Y ou can be social without smoking at all.\nYou think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’ s not. Smoking does\nnot relieve your nerves, it destroys them.\nOver and over , he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it\nclearly into your mind,” he says. “Y ou are losing nothing and you are\nmaking marvelous positive gains not only in health, ener gy and money but\nalso in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the\nlength and quality of your future life.”\nBy the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the most\nridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect smoking to\nbring you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of\nthe 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive  .\nNow , I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your mind\nand you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.\nWHERE CRA VINGS COME FROM\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper , underlying motive.\nI often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If\nyou were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’ t say, “Because I need\nfood to survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to\neat tacos because I have to eat to survive. The underlying motive is to\nobtain food and water even if my specific craving is for a taco.\nSome of our underlying motives include:  *' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 109}page_content='Conserve ener gy\nObtain food and water\nFind love and reproduce\nConnect and bond with others\nWin social acceptance and approval\nReduce uncertainty\nAchieve status and prestige\nA craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive.\nYour brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check\nInstagram or to play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to\nreduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety , to win social acceptance and\napproval, or to achieve status.\nLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it\ndoes not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying\nmotives of human nature.\nFind love and reproduce = using T inder\nConnect and bond with others = browsing Facebook\nWin social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram\nReduce uncertainty = searching on Google\nAchieve status and prestige = playing video games\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of\nold vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same.\nThe specific habits we perform dif fer based on the period of history .\nHere’ s the powerful part: there are many dif ferent ways to address the\nsame underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by\nsmoking a cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going\nfor a run. Y our current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the\nproblems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you\nassociate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming\nback to it.\nHabits are all about associations. These associations determine whether\nwe predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in our' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 110}page_content='discussion of the 1st Law , your brain is continually absorbing information\nand noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your\nbrain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next\nmoment.\nCue: Y ou notice that the stove is hot.\nPrediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.\nCue: Y ou see that the traf fic light turned green.\nPrediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely thr ough the intersection\nand get closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas.\nYou see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the\nappropriate response.\nThis all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits\nbecause every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it\nis actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how\nto act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past.\nYou are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.\nOur behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way ,\nour behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that\nhappen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.\nTwo people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the ur ge to smoke\nwhile the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good\nhabit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits\nis actually the prediction that precedes them.\nThese predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a\ncraving—a feeling, a desire, an ur ge. Feelings and emotions transform the\ncues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can\napply . They help explain what we are currently sensing. For instance,\nwhether or not you realize it, you are noticing how warm or cold you feel\nright now . If the temperature drops by one degree, you probably won’ t do\nanything. If the temperature drops ten degrees, however , you’ll feel cold\nand put on another layer of clothing. Feeling cold was the signal that\nprompted you to act. Y ou have been sensing the cues the entire time, but it' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 111}page_content='is only when you predict that you would be better of f in a dif ferent state that\nyou take action.\nA craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to\nchange your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap\nbetween what your body is currently sensing and what it wants  to be\nsensing. This gap between your current state and your desired state provides\na reason to act.\nDesire is the dif ference between where you are now and where you want\nto be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to\nfeel dif ferently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up\nor browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a\ncigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different.\nOur feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current\nstate or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.\nNeurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are\nimpaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions. W e have no signal\nof what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio\nDamasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good,\nbad, or indif ferent.”\nTo summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are\nreally an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives.\nWhenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to\ndo it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will\nhelp you feel loved or that watching Y ouTube will allow you to for get your\nfears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings,\nand we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment.\nHOW T O REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN T O ENJOY HARD HABITS\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them\nwith a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set\nshift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given\nday. You have to wake up early for work. Y ou have to make another sales\ncall for your business. Y ou have to cook dinner for your family .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 112}page_content='Now , imagine changing just one word: You don’ t “have” to. Y ou “get”\nto.\nYou get to wake up early for work. Y ou get to make another sales call for\nyour business. Y ou get to cook dinner for your family . By simply changing\none word, you shift the way you view each event. Y ou transition from\nseeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.\nThe key point is that both versions of reality are true. Y ou have  to do\nthose things, and you also get to do them. W e can find evidence for\nwhatever mind-set we choose.\nI once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair . When asked if\nit was dif ficult being confined, he responded, “  I’m not confined to my\nwheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’ t for my wheelchair , I would be\nbed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective\ncompletely transformed how he lived each day .\nReframing your habits to highlight their benefits  rather than their\ndrawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make\na habit seem more attractive.\nExer cise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task\nthat drains ener gy and wears you down. Y ou can just as easily view it as a\nway to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to\ngo run in the morning,” say “  It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”\nFinance.  Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However , you\ncan associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple\ntruth: living below your current means increases  your future means. The\nmoney you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.\nMeditation.  Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three\nseconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction\ninevitably pops into your mind. Y ou can transform frustration into delight\nwhen you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice\nreturning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you need\ndistractions to practice meditation.\nPregame jitters.  Many people feel anxious before delivering a big\npresentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker\nbreathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these\nfeelings negatively , then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret\nthese feelings positively , then we can respond with fluidity and grace. Y ou' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 113}page_content='can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline\nrush to help me concentrate.”\nThese little mind-set shifts aren’ t magic, but they can help change the\nfeelings you associate with a particular habit or situation.\nIf you want to take it a step further , you can create a motivation ritual  .\nYou simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy , then\nyou can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if\nyou always play the same song before having sex, then you’ll begin to link\nthe music with the act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press\nplay.\nEd Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsbur gh, benefited from a\nsimilar strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus\nand concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while\nwriting. I don’ t even have to play any music.” W ithout realizing it, he was\nconditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played\nsome music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten,\ntwenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically\nassociated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally .\nAthletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to\nperform. During my baseball career , I developed a specific ritual of\nstretching and throwing before each game. The whole sequence took about\nten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While it physically\nwarmed me up to play , more importantly , it put me in the right mental state.\nI began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling competitive and\nfocused. Even if I wasn’ t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done\nwith my ritual, I was in “game mode.”\nYou can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel\nhappier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like\npetting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine\nthat you perform every time befor e you do the thing you love. Maybe you\ntake three deep breaths and smile.\nThree deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.\nEventually , you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with\nbeing in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means  feeling happy . Once\nestablished, you can break it out anytime you need to change your\nemotional state. Stressed at work? T ake three deep breaths and smile. Sad' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 114}page_content='about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the\ncue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original\nsituation.\nThe key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe\nthe associations you have about them. It’ s not easy , but if you can\nreprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an\nattractive one.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it\nunattractive  .\nEvery behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying\nmotive.\nYour habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.\nThe cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.\nThe prediction leads to a feeling.\nHighlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem\nunattractive.\nHabits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings\nand unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.\nCreate a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately\nbefore a dif ficult habit.\nHOW T O CREA TE A GOOD HABIT\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious\n1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard.

They would be graded solely on the amount of work they\nproduced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos\nsubmitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety\nphotos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on.\nMeanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the\n“quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their\nwork. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester , but\nto get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image.\nAt the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos\nwere produced by the quantity  group. During the semester , these students\nwere busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting,\ntesting out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their\nmistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their\nskills. Meanwhile, the quality  group sat around speculating about\nperfection. In the end, they had little to show for their ef forts other than\nunverified theories and one mediocre photo.  *\nIt is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change:\nthe fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect\nidea for a side hustle. W e are so focused on figuring out the best approach' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 118}page_content='that we never get around to taking action. As V oltaire once wrote, “The best\nis the enemy of the good.”\nI refer to this as the dif ference between being in motion and taking\naction. The two ideas sound similar , but they’re not the same. When you’re\nin motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good\nthings, but they don’ t produce a result.\nAction, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an\noutcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’ s motion.\nIf I actually sit down and write an article, that’ s action. If I search for a\nbetter diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’ s motion. If I\nactually eat a healthy meal, that’ s action.\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by\nitself. It doesn’ t matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer ,\nthat motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will\nget the result you’re looking to achieve.\nIf motion doesn’ t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it\nbecause we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we\ndo it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without\nrunning the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It\ndoesn’ t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly , so we tend to avoid\nsituations where that might happen. And that’ s the biggest reason why you\nslip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.\nIt’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making\nprogress. Y ou think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential\nclients right now . This is good. W e’re moving in the right dir ection.”  Or, “I\nbrainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This is coming\ntogether .”\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really , you’re\njust preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of\nprocrastination, you need to change something. Y ou don’ t want to merely\nbe planning. Y ou want to be practicing.\nIf you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not\nperfection. Y ou don’ t need to map out every feature of a new habit. Y ou just\nneed to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need\nto get your reps in.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 119}page_content='HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALL Y TAKE T O FORM A NEW\nHABIT?\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively\nmore automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity , the\nmore the structure of your brain changes to become ef ficient at that activity .\nNeuroscientists call this long-term potentiation  , which refers to the\nstrengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent\npatterns of activity . With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and\nthe neural connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald\nHebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’ s Law: “\nNeurons that fire together wire together .”\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In\nmusicians, the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking a\nguitar string or pulling a violin bow—is lar ger than it is in nonmusicians.\nMathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior\nparietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and calculation. Its\nsize is directly correlated with the amount of time spent in the field; the\nolder and more experienced the mathematician, the greater the increase in\ngray matter .\nWhen scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they\nfound that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial\nmemory—was significantly lar ger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers.\nEven more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver\nretired. Like the muscles of the body responding to regular weight training,\nparticular regions of the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are\nabandoned.\nOf course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was\nrecognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the\nEnglish philosopher Geor ge H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new\nlanguage, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed\nmovements, great dif ficulty is felt, because the channels through which\neach sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has\nfrequent repetition cut a pathway , than this dif ficulty vanishes; the actions\nbecome so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 120}page_content='otherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientific evidence agree:\nrepetition is a form of change.\nEach time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural\ncircuit associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your\nreps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It\nis why the students who took tons of photos improved their skills while\nthose who merely theorized about perfect photos did not. One group\nengaged in active practice, the other in passive learning. One in action, the\nother in motion.\nAll habits follow a similar trajectory from ef fortful practice to automatic\nbehavior , a process known as automaticity  . Automaticity is the ability to\nperform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when\nthe nonconscious mind takes over .\nIt looks something like this:\nTHE HABIT LINE' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 121}page_content='FIGURE 1 1: In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of ef fort and\nconcentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier , but still\nrequires some conscious attention. W ith enough practice (point C), the habit\nbecomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold— the habit line\n—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been\nformed.\nOn the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers\ntrack the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten\nminutes each day . The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning\ncurves  , reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form\nbased on frequency , not time.\nWALKING 10 MINUTES PER DA Y' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 122}page_content='FIGURE 12:  This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking for ten\nminutes after breakfast each day . Notice that as the repetitions increase, so does\nautomaticity , until the behavior is as easy and automatic as it can be.\nOne of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to\nbuild a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many\ndoes it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are\nrequired to make a habit automatic?\nThere is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit\nformation. It doesn’ t matter if it’ s been twenty-one days or thirty days or\nthree hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the\nbehavior . You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred\ntimes. It’ s the frequency that makes the dif ference. Y our current habits have\nbeen internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of\nrepetitions. New habits require the same level of frequency . You need to\nstring together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly\nembedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.\nIn practice, it doesn’ t really matter how long it takes for a habit to\nbecome automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 123}page_content='take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less\nimportance.\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most ef fective way to\nmake practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change:\nmake it easy  . The chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly\nthat.\nChapter Summary\nThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy  .\nThe most ef fective form of learning is practice, not planning.\nFocus on taking action, not being in motion.\nHabit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes\nprogressively more automatic through repetition.\nThe amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as\nimportant as the number of times you have performed it.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 124}page_content='I\n12\nThe Law of Least Effort\nN HIS A WARD -WINNING  BOOK  , Guns, Germs, and Steel  , anthropologist\nand biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: dif ferent\ncontinents have dif ferent shapes. At first glance, this statement seems rather\nobvious and unimportant, but it turns out to have a profound impact on\nhuman behavior .\nThe primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the\nlandmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than\nwide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the\nlandmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite.\nThis massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According\nto Diamond, this dif ference in shape played a significant role in the spread\nof agriculture over the centuries.\nWhen agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an\neasier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones.\nThis is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar\nclimates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. These\nfactors allowed farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and\ngrow them along the entire stretch of land from France to China.\nTHE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHA VIOR' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 125}page_content='FIGURE 13:  The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary axis\nof the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates\nup-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture\nspread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere. The\nbehavior of farmers—even across hundreds or thousands of years—was\nconstrained by the amount of friction in the environment.\nBy comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to\nsouth. Just imagine how dif ferent the weather is in Florida compared to\nCanada. Y ou can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’ t help\nyou grow Florida oranges in the Canadian winter . Snow is a poor substitute\nfor soil. In order to spread crops along north-south routes, farmers would\nneed to find and domesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.\nAs a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and\nEurope than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries,\nthis small dif ference had a very big impact. Increased food production\nallowed for more rapid population growth. W ith more people, these cultures' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 126}page_content='were able to build stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new\ntechnologies. The changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly\nfarther , a population that grew slightly faster—but compounded into\nsubstantial dif ferences over time.\nThe spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of\nBehavior Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that\nmotivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really  wanted it, you’d\nactually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do\nwhat is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will\ntell you, this is a smart strategy , not a dumb one.\nEnergy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever\npossible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Ef fort, which states\nthat when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally\ngravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.  * For\nexample, expanding your farm to the east where you can grow the same\ncrops rather than heading north where the climate is dif ferent. Out of all the\npossible actions we could take, the one that is realized is the one that\ndelivers the most value for the least ef fort. W e are motivated to do what is\neasy.\nEvery action requires a certain amount of ener gy. The more ener gy\nrequired, the less likely it is to occur . If your goal is to do a hundred push-\nups per day , that’ s a lot of ener gy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated\nand excited, you can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days,\nsuch a massive ef fort feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of\ndoing one push-up per day requires almost no ener gy to get started. And the\nless ener gy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur .\nLook at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see that it\ncan be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling\non our phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of\nour time because they can be performed almost without ef fort. They are\nremarkably convenient.\nIn a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.\nDieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling\ncalm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly . You don’ t actually want\nthe habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The\ngreater the obstacle—that is, the more dif ficult the habit—the more friction' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 127}page_content='there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to\nmake your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’ t feel like\nit. If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely\nto follow through on them.\nBut what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If\nwe’re all so lazy , then how do you explain people accomplishing hard\nthings like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount Everest?\nCertainly , you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is that\nsome days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like\ngiving in. On the tough days, it’ s crucial to have as many things working in\nyour favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life\nnaturally throws your way . The less friction you face, the easier it is for\nyour stronger self to emer ge. The idea behind make it easy  is not to only do\neasy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do\nthings that payof f in the long run.\nHOW T O ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFOR T\nImagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some\nwater can flow through, but not very much. If you want to increase the rate\nat which water passes through the hose, you have two options. The first\noption is to crank up the valve and force more water out. The second option\nis to simply remove the bend in the hose and let water flow through\nnaturally .\nTrying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like\ntrying to force water through a bent hose. Y ou can do it, but it requires a lot\nof effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your\nhabits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than\ntrying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.\nOne of the most ef fective ways to reduce the friction associated with\nyour habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed\nenvironment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can\nalso optimize your environment to make actions easier . For example, when\ndeciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is\nalready along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 128}page_content='they fit into the flow of your life. Y ou are more likely to go to the gym if it\nis on your way to work because stopping doesn’ t add much friction to your\nlifestyle. By comparison, if the gym is of f the path of your normal commute\n—even by just a few blocks—now you’re going “out of your way” to get\nthere.\nPerhaps even more ef fective is reducing the friction within your home or\noffice. T oo often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. W e try\nto follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. W e try to\nwrite a book in a chaotic household. W e try to concentrate while using a\nsmartphone filled with distractions. It doesn’ t have to be this way . We can\nremove the points of friction that hold us back. This is precisely what\nelectronics manufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s.\nIn an article published in the New Y orker  titled “Better All the T ime,”\nJames Suroweicki writes:\n“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean\nproduction,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the\nproduction process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’ t\nhave to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result was\nthat Japanese factories were more ef ficient and Japanese products were\nmore reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls for American-\nmade color televisions were five times as common as for Japanese\ntelevisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long to\nassemble their sets.”\nI like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction  . * The Japanese\ncompanies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process\nand eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted ef fort, they added customers\nand revenue. Similarly , when we remove the points of friction that sap our\ntime and ener gy, we can achieve more with less ef fort. (This is one reason\ntidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and\nlightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)\nIf you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of\nthe things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction\nfrom your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for\ngroceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions.\nRide-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. T ext\nmessaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 129}page_content='Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to\nreduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to\nautomate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the\nnumber of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks\nrequired to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-\nunderstand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.\nWhen the first voice-activated speakers were released—products like\nGoogle Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what\nhe liked about the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to\nsay “Play some country music” than to pull out his phone, open the music\napp, and pick a playlist. Of course, just a few years earlier , having unlimited\naccess to music in your pocket was a remarkably frictionless behavior\ncompared to driving to the store and buying a CD. Business is a never -\nending quest to deliver the same result in an easier fashion.\nSimilar strategies have been used ef fectively by governments. When the\nBritish government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they switched\nfrom sending citizens to a web page where the tax form could be\ndownloaded to linking directly to the form. Reducing that one step in the\nprocess increased the response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. For a\ncountry like the United Kingdom, those percentage points represent\nmillions in tax revenue.\nThe central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing\nis as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes\ndown to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits\nand increase the friction associated with our bad ones.\nPRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE\nOswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is also\nsomeone who understands the power of priming his environment.\nNuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to\nas “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes watching television,\nhe places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the\ncouch, and folds the blanket. When he leaves his car , he throws any trash\naway . Whenever he takes a shower , he wipes down the toilet while the' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 130}page_content='shower is warming up. (As he notes, the “  perfect time to clean the toilet is\nright before you wash yourself in the shower anyway .”) The purpose of\nresetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action, but to\nprepare for the next action.\n“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols\nwrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuf f always stays in\ngood shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy . I’m\njust proactively lazy . It gives you so much time back.”\nWhenever you or ganize a space for its intended purpose, you are\npriming it to make the next action easy . For instance, my wife keeps a box\nof greeting cards that are presorted by occasion—birthday , sympathy ,\nwedding, graduation, and more. Whenever necessary , she grabs an\nappropriate card and sends it of f. She is incredibly good at remembering to\nsend cards because she has reduced the friction of doing so. For years, I was\nthe opposite. Someone would have a baby and I would think, “I should send\na card.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I remembered to pick\none up at the store, it was too late. The habit wasn’ t easy .\nThere are many ways to prime your environment so it’ s ready for\nimmediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on\nthe stove, set the cooking spray on the counter , and lay out any plates and\nutensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast\nwill be easy .\nWant to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing\ntools on top of your desk, within easy reach.\nWant to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and\nwater bottle ahead of time.\nWant to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on\nweekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to\nhealthy , ready-to-eat options during the week.\nThese are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least\nresistance.\nYou can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make\nbad behaviors dif ficult. If you find yourself watching too much television,' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 131}page_content='for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can\nsay out loud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates\njust enough friction to prevent mindless viewing.\nIf that doesn’ t do it, you can take it a step further . Unplug the television\nand take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra\nten seconds to turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the\ntelevision out of the living room and into a closet after each use. Y ou can be\nsure you’ll only take it out when you really  want to watch something. The\ngreater the friction, the less likely the habit.\nWhenever possible, I leave my phone in a dif ferent room until lunch.\nWhen it’ s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at all. But\nwhen it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high\nenough that I won’ t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get three to four\nhours each morning when I can work without interruption.\nIf sticking your phone in another room doesn’ t seem like enough, tell a\nfriend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a\ncoworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to you at\nlunch.\nIt is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted\nbehavior . When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’ t see it, I\ndrink less. When I delete social media apps from my phone, it can be weeks\nbefore I download them again and log in. These tricks are unlikely to curb a\ntrue addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the\ndifference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one.\nImagine the cumulative impact of making dozens of these changes and\nliving in an environment designed to make the good behaviors easier and\nthe bad behaviors harder .\nWhether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent,\na coach, or a leader , we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can\nwe design a world where it’ s easy to do what’ s right?” Redesign your life so\nthe actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.\nChapter Summary' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 132}page_content='Human behavior follows the Law of Least Ef fort.

In 1992, she was awarded a\nMacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has\nspent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her original works.\nShe also credits much of her success to simple daily habits.\n“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30\nA.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my\nhat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to\ntake me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First A venue, where I\nwork out for two hours.\n“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body\nthrough each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell\nthe driver where to go I have completed the ritual.\n“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it\n—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it\nor do it dif ferently . It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one\nless thing to think about.”\nHailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid\nexample of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 134}page_content='Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given\nday are done out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the\ntrue influence of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest.\nHabits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that\nfollow . Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also\nshape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.\nHabits are like the entrance ramp to a highway . They lead you down a\npath and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior . It\nseems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start\ndoing something dif ferent. Y ou sit through a bad movie for two hours. Y ou\nkeep snacking even when you’re already full. Y ou check your phone for\n“just a second” and soon you have spent twenty minutes staring at the\nscreen. In this way , the habits you follow without thinking often determine\nthe choices you make when you are thinking.\nEach evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that\nshapes the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and\neither we change into our workout clothes and head to the gym or we crash\nonto the couch, order Indian food, and watch The Office  . * Similar to\nTwyla Tharp hailing the cab, the ritual is changing into my workout clothes.\nIf I change clothes, I know the workout will happen. Everything that\nfollows—driving to the gym, deciding which exercises to do, stepping\nunder the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first step.\nEvery day , there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized\nimpact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments  . The moment you\ndecide between ordering takeout or cooking dinner . The moment you\nchoose between driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you\ndecide between starting your homework or grabbing the video game\ncontroller . These choices are a fork in the road.\nDECISIVE MOMENTS' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 135}page_content='FIGURE 14:  The dif ference between a good day and a bad day is often a few\nproductive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork\nin the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day and can ultimately lead\nto very dif ferent outcomes.\nDecisive moments set the options available to your future self. For\ninstance, walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it\ndetermines what you’ll be eating for lunch. T echnically , you are in control\nof what you order , but in a lar ger sense, you can only order an item if it is\non the menu. If you walk into a steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib\neye, but not sushi. Y our options are constrained by what’ s available. They\nare shaped by the first choice.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 136}page_content='We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the\ndecisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made\nup of many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine\nthe path you take. These little choices stack up, each one setting the\ntrajectory for how you spend the next chunk of time.\nHabits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the\ngym.\nTHE TWO-MINUTE RULE\nEven when you know you should start small, it’ s easy to start too big. When\nyou dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and\nyou end up trying to do too much too soon. The most ef fective way I know\nto counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule  , which states,\n“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”\nYou’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute\nversion:\n“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”\n“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “T ake out my yoga mat.”\n“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”\n“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”\n“Run three miles” becomes “T ie my running shoes.”\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can\nmeditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away .\nAnd, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once\nyou’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A\nnew habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow  can be\nchallenging, but the first two minutes should be easy . What you want is a\n“gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.\nYou can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your\ndesired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to\n“very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 137}page_content='hard. W alking ten thousand steps is moderately dif ficult. W alking ten\nminutes is easy . And putting on your running shoes is very easy . Your goal\nmight be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your\nrunning shoes.

But the point is not to\ndo one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a\nhabit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the\nbasic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer\ndetails. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the\neasy thing on a more consistent basis. Y ou have to standardize before you\ncan optimize.\nAs you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply\nbecome a ritual at the beginning of a lar ger routine. This is not merely a\nhack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a dif ficult\nskill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it\nbecomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do\ngreat things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make\nit easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same\ncreative ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By\ndeveloping a consistent power -down habit, you make it easier to get to bed\nat a reasonable time each night. Y ou may not be able to automate the whole\nprocess, but you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start\nand the rest will follow .\nThe T wo-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. Y ou know\nthat the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 138}page_content='you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page\nor do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’ s a mental trick,\nwhy would you fall for it?\nIf the T wo-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and\nthen stop. Go for a run, but you must  stop after two minutes. Start\nmeditating, but you must  stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you\nmust  stop after two minutes. It’ s not a strategy for starting, it’ s the whole\nthing. Y our habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.\nOne of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In\nthe beginning, he went to the gym each day , but he told himself he wasn’ t\nallowed to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym,\nexercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few\nweeks, he looked around and thought, “W ell, I’m always coming here\nanyway . I might as well start staying a little longer .” A few years later , the\nweight was gone.\nJournaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from\ngetting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper , but most people give\nup after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore.\n* The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg\nMcKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily\njournaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always\nstopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway\nbelieved in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to\nalways stop when you are going good,” he said.\nStrategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the\nidentity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—\neven if it’ s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new\nidentity . You’re not worried about getting in shape. Y ou’re focused on\nbecoming the type of person who doesn’ t miss workouts. Y ou’re taking the\nsmallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be.\nWe rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by\nthe end goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of\nguitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than\nnever picking up a book. It’ s better to do less than you hoped than to do\nnothing at all.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 139}page_content='At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up\neach day , you can combine the T wo-Minute Rule with a technique we call\nhabit shaping  to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start\nby mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior .\nThen, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on\njust the first two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the\nnext level.

But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects,\nentertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’ s publisher\nresponded by setting a deadline less than six months away . The book had to\nbe finished by February 1831.\nHugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected\nall of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a lar ge chest.\nHe was left with nothing to wear except a lar ge shawl. Lacking any suitable\nclothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during\nthe fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback of Notr e Dame  was published\ntwo weeks early on January 14, 1831.  *\nSometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more\nabout making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of\nBehavior Change: make it difficult  . If you find yourself continually\nstruggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from\nVictor Hugo and make your bad habits more dif ficult by creating what\npsychologists call a commitment device  .\nA commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls\nyour actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior , bind you to' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 142}page_content='good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When V ictor Hugo shut his\nclothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment\ndevice.  *\nThere are many ways to create a commitment device. Y ou can reduce\novereating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk\nsize. Y ou can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and\nonline poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of\nathletes who have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave\ntheir wallets at home during the week before weigh-in so they won’ t be\ntempted to buy fast food.\nAs another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal\npurchased an outlet timer , which is an adapter that he plugged in between\nhis internet router and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet\ntimer cuts of f the power to the router . When the internet goes of f, everyone\nknows it is time to go to bed.\nCommitment devices are useful because they enable you to take\nadvantage of good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation.\nWhenever I’m looking to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to\nsplit my meal and box half of it to go befor e the meal is served. If I waited\nuntil the meal came out and told myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never\nwork.\nThe key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out\nof the good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get\nin shape, schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited\nabout the business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and\nset up a consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is\nto cancel the meeting, which requires ef fort and may cost money .\nCommitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in\nthe future by making bad habits dif ficult in the present. However , we can do\neven better . We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.\nHOW T O AUT OMA TE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT\nAGAIN' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 143}page_content='John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his\nchildhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father ’s\nsawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio\nand opened a small supply store for coal miners.\nIt seemed like a good opportunity . The store faced little competition and\nenjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money .\nThat was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.\nIn the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were\nkept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were\nno video cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions.\nUnless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the\nday, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was dif ficult to prevent theft.\nAs Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an\nadvertisement for a new invention called Ritty’ s Incorruptible Cashier .\nDesigned by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty , it was the first cash\nregister . The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after\neach transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.\nEmployee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months,\nPatterson’ s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—\nthe equivalent of more than $100,000 today .\nPatterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed\nbusinesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’ s invention and opened the\nNational Cash Register Company . Ten years later , National Cash Register\nhad over one thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of\nthe most successful businesses of its time.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.\nIncrease the friction until you don’ t even have the option to act. The\nbrilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by\nmaking stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the\nemployees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.\nSome actions—like installing a cash register—pay of f again and again.\nThese onetime choices require a little bit of ef fort up front but create\nincreasing value over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice\ncan deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their\nfavorite onetime actions that lead to better long-term habits.

T ypically , they involve putting technology to work for you.\nTechnology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and\ncomplicated into behaviors that are easy , painless, and simple. It is the most\nreliable and ef fective way to guarantee the right behavior .\nThis is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to\nbecome habitual. Things you have to do monthly or yearly—like\nrebalancing your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently\nenough to become a habit, so they benefit in particular from technology\n“remembering” to do them for you.\nOther examples include:\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.\nPersonal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an\nautomatic wage deduction.\nCooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.\nProductivity: Social media browsing can be cut of f with a website\nblocker .\nWhen you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your\neffort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to\nthe authority of technology frees up time and ener gy to pour into the next\nstage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North\nWhitehead wrote, “  Civilization advances by extending the number of\noperations we can perform without thinking about them.”\nOf course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Binge-\nwatching becomes a habit because you have to put more ef fort in to stop\nlooking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button\nto advance to the next episode, Netflix or Y ouTube will autoplay it for you.\nAll you have to do is keep your eyes open.\nTechnology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on\nyour smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger , you can\nhave food delivered to your door . At the slightest hint of boredom, you can\nget lost in the vast expanse of social media. When the ef fort required to act\non your desires becomes ef fectively zero, you can find yourself slipping' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 146}page_content='into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is\nthat we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without\nmaking time for more dif ficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.\nI often find myself gravitating toward social media during any\ndowntime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my\nphone. It’ s easy to write of f these minor distractions as “just taking a\nbreak,” but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant\ntug of “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing anything of\nconsequence. (I’m not the only one. The average person spends over two\nhours per day on social media. What could you do with an extra six hundred\nhours per year?)\nDuring the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time\nmanagement strategy . Every Monday , my assistant would reset the\npasswords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each\ndevice. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday , she would send\nme the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media\nhad to of fer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If you\ndon’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset\neach other ’s passwords each week.)\nOne of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. W ithin the first\nweek of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’ t need to\ncheck it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’ t need it each\nday. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad\nhabit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the\nmotivation to work on more meaningful tasks.

By 1998, over\nnine million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan\nand a transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports\nin the region. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the\nstandard urban amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was\nalso one of the least  livable cities in the world.\nOver 60 percent of Karachi’ s residents lived in squatter settlements and\nslums. These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift\nhouses cobbled together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded\nmaterials. There was no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean\nwater supply . When dry , the streets were a combination of dust and trash.\nWhen wet, they became a muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived\nin pools of stagnant water , and children played among the garbage.\nThe unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.\nContaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and\nabdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were\nmalnourished. W ith so many people crammed into such a small space,\nviruses and bacterial infections spread rapidly . It was this public health\ncrisis that had brought Stephen Luby to Pakistan.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 151}page_content='Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation,\nthe simple habit of washing your hands could make a real dif ference in the\nhealth of the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were\nalready aware that handwashing was important.\nAnd yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their\nhands in a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands under\nthe water quickly . Others would only wash one hand. Many would simply\nforget to wash their hands before preparing food. Everyone said\nhandwashing was important, but few people made a habit out of it. The\nproblem wasn’ t knowledge. The problem was consistency .\nThat was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to\nsupply the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard\nbar of soap, using Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.\n“ In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The\nstudy participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The soap\nfoamed easily , and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It\nsmelled great. Instantly , handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.\n“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as\nhabit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product\nthat provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of\ntoothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable\nsensory feedback, like flossing one’ s teeth. The marketing team at Procter\n& Gamble talked about trying to create a positive handwashing\nexperience.”\nWithin months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children\nin the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by\n48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.\nThe long-term ef fects were even better . “We went back to some of the\nhouseholds in Karachi six years after ,” Luby told me. “  Over 95 percent of\nhouseholds who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash\ntheir hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when\nour study team visited. . . . W e had not given any soap to the intervention\ngroup for over five years, but during the trial they had become so habituated\nto wash their hands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a\npowerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it\nsatisfying.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 152}page_content='We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\nsatisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones\nlike washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are\nsignals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.”\nPleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and\nrepeating.\nTake the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold\ncommercially throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’ t until W rigley launched in\n1891 that it became a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from\nrelatively bland resins—chewy , but not tasty . Wrigley revolutionized the\nindustry by adding flavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made the\nproduct flavorful and fun to use. Then they went a step further and began\npushing chewing gum as a pathway to a clean mouth. Advertisements told\nreaders to “Refresh Y our T aste.”\nTasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of\nimmediate reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use.\nConsumption skyrocketed, and Wrigley became the lar gest chewing gum\ncompany in the world.\nToothpaste had a similar trajectory . Manufacturers enjoyed great success\nwhen they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their\nproducts. These flavors don’ t improve the ef fectiveness of toothpaste. They\nsimply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing\nyour teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne\nbecause she didn’ t like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a\nstronger mint flavor , which proved to be more satisfying.\nConversely , if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to\nrepeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a\nnarcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time\nwith this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever\nhe was around. W ithin a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he\nfound her so uninteresting.\nStories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:\nWhat is r ewar ded is r epeated. What is punished is avoided.  You learn what\nto do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished\nfor doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions\ndestroy them.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 153}page_content='The first three laws of behavior change— make it obvious, make it\nattractive,  and make it easy  —increase the odds that a behavior will be\nperformed this time. The fourth law of behavior change— make it satisfying\n—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes\nthe habit loop.\nBut there is a trick. W e are not looking for just any type of satisfaction.\nWe are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nTHE MISMA TCH BETWEEN IMMEDIA TE AND DELA YED\nREW ARDS\nImagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraf fe or an\nelephant or a lion. On any given day , most of your decisions have an\nimmediate impact. Y ou are always thinking about what to eat or where to\nsleep or how to avoid a predator . You are constantly focused on the present\nor the very near future. Y ou live in what scientists call an immediate-r eturn\nenvir onment  because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate\noutcomes.\nNow switch back to your human self. In modern society , many of the\nchoices you make today will not benefit you immediately . If you do a good\njob at work, you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today ,\nperhaps you won’ t be overweight next year . If you save money now , maybe\nyou’ll have enough for retirement decades from now . You live in what\nscientists call a delayed-r eturn envir onment  because you can work for years\nbefore your actions deliver the intended payof f.\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.\nThe earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens  ,\nare approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first\nhumans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular , the\nneocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for\nhigher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred\nthousand years ago as today . You are walking around with the same\nhardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.\nIt is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society\nhas shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.  * Compared to' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 154}page_content='the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new . In the last one hundred\nyears, we have seen the rise of the car , the airplane, the television, the\npersonal computer , the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé. The world\nhas changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.\nSimilar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent\ntheir days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking\nshelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant\ngratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after thousands\nof generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to\nprefer quick payof fs to long-term ones.\nBehavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency  . That\nis, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.  * You\nvalue the present more than the future. Usually , this tendency serves us\nwell. A reward that is certain  right now is typically worth more than one\nthat is merely possible  in the future. But occasionally , our bias toward\ninstant gratification causes problems.\nWhy would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung\ncancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk\nof obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result\nin sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain\nprioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad\nhabits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. Smoking might kill\nyou in ten years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine cravings now .\nOvereating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the moment. Sex—\nsafe or not—provides pleasure right away . Disease and infection won’ t\nshow up for days or weeks, even years.\nEvery habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately ,\nthese outcomes are often misaligned. W ith our bad habits, the immediate\noutcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. W ith good\nhabits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the\nultimate outcome feels good. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat\nexplained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens\nthat when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences\nare disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a\nhabit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 155}page_content='Put another way , the costs of your good habits are in the present. The\ncosts of your bad habits are in the future.\nThe brain’ s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’ t\nrely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a\nbook, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future\nself. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to\nsee the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. W e all want better\nlives for our future selves. However , when the moment of decision arrives,\ninstant gratification usually wins. Y ou are no longer making a choice for\nFuture Y ou, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier . You are\nchoosing for Present Y ou, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained.\nAs a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the\nmore strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term\ngoals.  *\nWith a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some\nbehaviors and avoid others, let’ s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior\nChange: What is immediately  rewarded is repeated. What is immediately\npunished is avoided.\nOur preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about\nsuccess: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day\nchasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of\ndelayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face\nless competition and often get a bigger payof f. As the saying goes, the last\nmile is always the least crowded.\nThis is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at\ndelaying gratification have higher SA T scores, lower levels of substance\nabuse, lower likelihood of obesity , better responses to stress, and superior\nsocial skills. W e’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay\nwatching television and get your homework done, you’ll generally learn\nmore and get better grades. If you don’ t buy desserts and chips at the store,\nyou’ll often eat healthier food when you get home. At some point, success\nin nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of\na delayed reward.\nHere’ s the problem: most people know  that delaying gratification is the\nwise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy ,\nproductive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 156}page_content='decisive moment. Thankfully , it’s possible to train yourself to delay\ngratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not\nagainst it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure\nto the habits that pay of f in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to\nones that don’ t.\nHOW T O TURN INST ANT GRA TIFICA TION T O YOUR\nADV ANT AGE\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’ s in\na small way . The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid of f and\nthat the work was worth the ef fort.\nIn a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the\nreal world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have\nprovided you with something. Early on, it’ s all sacrifice. Y ou’ve gone to the\ngym a few times, but you’re not stronger or fitter or faster—at least, not in\nany noticeable sense. It’ s only months later , once you shed a few pounds or\nyour arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its\nown sake. In the beginning, you need a reason to stay on track. This is why\nimmediate rewards are essential. They keep you excited while the delayed\nrewards accumulate in the background.\nWhat we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate\nrewards—is the ending of a behavior . The ending of any experience is vital\nbecause we tend to remember it more than other phases. Y ou want the\nending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use\nreinfor cement  , which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to\nincrease the rate of a behavior . Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter\n5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to\nstart. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it\nsatisfying when you finish.\nImmediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with\nhabits of avoidance  , which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be\nchallenging to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol\nthis month” because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or\ndon’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 157}page_content='action in the first place. All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there\nisn’t much satisfying about that.\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. Y ou want to make\navoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you\nwant—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the\nsame amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? T ransfer\n$5. Pass on another month of Netflix? Move $10 over . It’s like creating a\nloyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save\nmoney toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. Y ou\nare making it satisfying to do nothing.\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to\nstop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled their\nsavings account “T rip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat,\nthey transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year , they put the\nmoney toward the vacation.\nIt is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that\nreinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new\njacket is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it\ndoesn’ t work if you’re trying to budget and save money . Instead, taking a\nbubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding\nyourself with free time, which aligns with your ultimate goal of more\nfreedom and financial independence. Similarly , if your reward for\nexercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for\nconflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your\nreward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care\nof your body . Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term\nvision of being a healthy person.\nEventually , as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more ener gy, and\nreduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the\nsecondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer . You do it\nbecause it’ s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit\nbecomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to\nfollow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.\nThat said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new identity\nto emer ge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short\nterm while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 158}page_content='In summary , a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of\nreinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a\nrefreshing mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can of fer the\nimmediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is\nenjoyable.\nChapter Summary\nThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying  .\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is\nsatisfying.\nThe human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over\ndelayed rewards.\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately\nrewar ded is r epeated.

Abbotsford was a relatively small\nsuburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby V ancouver , where most of the\nbig business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that\nDyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made\nbrisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.\nDyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled\nwith 120 paper clips. The other was empty . As soon as he settled in each\nday, he would make a sales call. Immediately after , he would move one\npaper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin\nagain. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I\nwould keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar ,”\nhe told me.\nWithin eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm.\nBy age twenty-four , he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of\n$125,000 today . Not long after , he landed a six-figure job with another\ncompany .\nI like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the\nyears, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways.\nOne woman shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she\nwrote a page of her book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the\nnext after each set of push-ups.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 160}page_content='Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper\nclips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a\nresult, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate\nsatisfaction to any activity . Visual measurement comes in many forms: food\njournals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software\ndownload, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to\nmeasure your progress is with a habit tracker  .\nHOW T O KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK\nA habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The\nmost basic format is to get a calendar and cross of f each day you stick with\nyour routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday , Wednesday , and\nFriday , each of those dates gets an X . As time rolls by , the calendar\nbecomes a record of your habit streak.\nCountless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous\nwas Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty , Franklin carried a small\nbooklet everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues.\nThis list included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in\nsomething useful” and “A void trifling conversation.” At the end of each\nday, Franklin would open his booklet and record his progress.\nJerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of\nwriting jokes. In the documentary Comedian  , he explains that his goal is\nsimply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day . In other\nwords, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how\ninspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his\nstreak.\n“Don’ t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’ t break the chain of\nsales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’ t break the\nchain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’ t break\nthe chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive\nportfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of\nBehavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive,\nand satisfying.\nLet’s break down each one.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 161}page_content='Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.\nRecording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one.\nHabit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X ’s\non your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the\ncalendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has\nshown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight,\nquitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to\nimprove than those who don’ t. One study of more than sixteen hundred\npeople found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight\nas those who did not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the ur ge\nto change it.\nHabit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view\nof our own behavior . We think we act better than we do. Measurement\noffers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice\nwhat’ s really going on each day . One glance at the paper clips in the\ncontainer and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’ t)\nbeen putting in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less\nlikely to lie to yourself.\nBenefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.\nThe most ef fective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal\nthat we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down\nthat path. In this way , habit tracking can have an addictive ef fect on\nmotivation. Each small win feeds your desire.\nThis can be particularly powerful on a bad day . When you’re feeling\ndown, it’ s easy to for get about all the progress you have already made.\nHabit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder\nof how far you’ve come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can\nmotivate you to get started because you don’ t want to lose your progress by\nbreaking the streak.\nBenefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 162}page_content='This is the most crucial benefit of all. T racking can become its own form of\nreward. It is satisfying to cross an item of f your to-do list, to complete an\nentry in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar . It feels good to\nwatch your results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length\nof your book manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to\nendure.\nHabit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on\nthe process rather than the result. Y ou’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs,\nyou’re just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person\nwho doesn’ t miss workouts.\nIn summary , habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you\nto act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are\nmaking and don’ t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you\nrecord another successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit\ntracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of\nperson you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and\nintrinsic gratification.  *\nYou may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited\nso long to talk about it?\nDespite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a simple\nreason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel\nlike a burden because it forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying\nto build and the habit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle\nwhen you’re already struggling to follow a diet. W riting down every sales\ncall seems tedious when you’ve got work to do. It feels easier to say , “I’ll\njust eat less.” Or , “I’ll try harder .” Or , “I’ll remember to do it.” People\ninevitably tell me things like, “I have a decision journal, but I wish I used it\nmore.” Or , “I recorded my workouts for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been\nthere myself. I once made a food log to track my calories. I managed to do\nit for one meal  and then gave up.\nTracking isn’ t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire\nlife. But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’ s only\ntemporary .\nWhat can we do to make tracking easier?\nFirst, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. Y ou’ll\nprobably be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 163}page_content='knowing it. Y our credit card statement tracks how often you go out to eat.\nYour Fitbit registers how many steps you take and how long you sleep.\nYour calendar records how many new places you travel to each year . Once\nyou know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it\neach week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every\nday.\nSecond, manual tracking should be limited to your most important\nhabits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track\nten.\nFinally , record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.\nThe completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach\nallows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5\nwith habit tracking.\nThe habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\nAfter I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip\nover.\nAfter I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout\njournal.\nAfter I put my plate in the dishwasher , I will write down what I ate.\nThese tactics can make tracking your habits easier . Even if you aren’ t the\ntype of person who enjoys recording your behavior , I think you’ll find a few\nweeks of measurements to be insightful. It’ s always interesting to see how\nyou’ve actually  been spending your time.\nThat said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important\nthan any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits\nslide of f track.\nHOW T O RECOVER QUICKL Y WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK\nDOWN' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 164}page_content='No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life\nwill interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an\nemer gency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your\nfamily needs a little more of your time.\nWhenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule:\nnever miss twice.\nIf I miss one day , I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing\none workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row . Maybe I’ll\neat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’ t be\nperfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get\nstarted on the next one.\nThe first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of\nrepeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice\nis the start of a new habit.\nThis is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can\nhave a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when\nsuccessful people fail, they rebound quickly . The breaking of a habit\ndoesn’ t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\nI think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’ t do a\nhabit as well or as completely as I would like. T oo often, we fall into an all-\nor-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the\nproblem is thinking that if you can’ t do something perfectly , then you\nshouldn’ t do it at all.\nYou don’ t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or\nbusy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you\nstart with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only\nneed a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a\n33 percent loss is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie\nMunger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it\nunnecessarily .”\nThis is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones.\nSluggish days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued\nfrom previous good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints,\na push-up, anything really—is huge. Don’ t put up a zero. Don’ t let losses\neat into your compounding.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 165}page_content='Furthermore, it’ s not always about what happens during the workout. It’ s\nabout being the type of person who doesn’ t miss workouts. It’ s easy to train\nwhen you feel good, but it’ s crucial to show up when you don’ t feel like it\n—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes\nmay not improve your performance, but it reaf firms your identity .\nThe all-or -nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can\nderail your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are using a\nhabit tracker—is measuring the wrong thing.\nKNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) T O TRACK A HABIT\nSay you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is doing\na good job. One way to measure success is to track how many customers\npay for a meal each day . If more customers come in, the food must be good.\nIf fewer customers come in, something must be wrong.\nHowever , this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a limited\npicture of what’ s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal\ndoesn’ t mean they enjoy  the meal. Even dissatisfied customers are unlikely\nto dine and dash. In fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the food might\nbe getting worse but you’re making up for it with marketing or discounts or\nsome other method. Instead, it may be more ef fective to track how many\ncustomers finish  their meal or perhaps the percentage of customers who\nleave a generous tip.\nThe dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven\nby the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured\nby quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for\nquarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the\nscale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means\nembracing crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind\nwants to “win” whatever game is being played.\nThis pitfall is evident in many areas of life. W e focus on working long\nhours instead of getting meaningful work done. W e care more about getting\nten thousand steps than we do about being healthy . We teach for\nstandardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity , and critical' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 166}page_content='thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the\nwrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior .\nThis is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’ s Law . Named after the\neconomist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “  When a measure\nbecomes a tar get, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only\nuseful when it guides you and adds context to a lar ger picture, not when it\nconsumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall\nsystem.\nIn our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue\nanything ephemeral, soft, and dif ficult to quantify . We mistakenly think the\nfactors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you\ncan measure something doesn’ t mean it’ s the most important thing. And just\nbecause you can’t measure something doesn’ t mean it’ s not important at all.\nAll of this to say , it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place. It\ncan feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the\nmeasurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many\nways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to\nsomething entirely dif ferent.\nThis is why nonscale victories  can be ef fective for weight loss. The\nnumber on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number ,\nyour motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or\nyou wake up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid\nways to track your improvement. If you’re not feeling motivated by the\nnumber on the scale, perhaps it’ s time to focus on a dif ferent measurement\n—one that gives you more signals of progress.\nNo matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking of fers a\nsimple way to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement\nprovides a little bit of evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and\na brief moment of immediate pleasure for a job well done.\nChapter Summary\nOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 167}page_content='A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—\nlike marking an X on a calendar .\nHabit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your\nhabits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.\nDon’ t break the chain.

He founded the Harvard Negotiation\nProject and worked with numerous countries and world leaders on peace\nresolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic compromises. But it was in the\n1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear war escalated, that Fisher\ndeveloped perhaps his most interesting idea.\nAt the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could\nprevent nuclear war , and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting\npresident would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of\npeople but would never actually see anyone die because he would always\nbe thousands of miles away .\n“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear]\ncode number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to\nthe heart of a volunteer . The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy\nbutcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted\nto fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first,\nwith his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, ‘Geor ge,\nI’m sorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 169}page_content='realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House\ncarpet. It’ s reality brought home.\n“ When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God,\nthat’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’ s\njudgment. He might never push the button.’”\nThroughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have\ncovered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying.\nFisher ’s proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately\nunsatisfying.\nJust as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is\nsatisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending\nis painful. Pain is an ef fective teacher . If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If\na failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and\nmore costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a\nbad review forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a\ncustomer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of\ncutting the wrong blood vessel makes a sur geon master human anatomy and\ncut carefully . When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly .\nThe more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior . If you want to\nprevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an\ninstant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.\nWe repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way , and that makes\nthem hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament\nis to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior .\nThere can’ t be a gap between the action and the consequences.\nAs soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to\nchange. Customers pay their bills on time when they are char ged a late fee.\nStudents show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. W e’ll\njump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.\nThere is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on punishment\nto change behavior , then the strength of the punishment must match the\nrelative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. T o be productive, the\ncost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. T o be\nhealthy , the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise.\nGetting fined for smoking in a restaurant or failing to recycle adds' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 170}page_content='consequence to an action. Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful\nenough and reliably enforced.\nIn general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the\nconsequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior . The\nmore global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely\nit is to influence individual behavior .\nThankfully , there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to\nany bad habit: create a habit contract  .\nTHE HABIT CONTRACT\nThe first seat belt law was passed in New Y ork on December 1, 1984. At\nthe time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a seat\nbelt—but that was all about to change.\nWithin five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. T oday ,\nwearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states.\nAnd it’ s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts has\nchanged dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans\nbuckled up each time they got in a car . In just over thirty years, there was a\ncomplete reversal in the habits of millions of people.\nLaws and regulations are an example of how government can change our\nhabits by creating a social contract. As a society , we collectively agree to\nabide by certain rules and then enforce them as a group. Whenever a new\npiece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning smoking\ninside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an example of a social\ncontract shaping our habits. The group agrees to act in a certain way , and if\nyou don’ t follow along, you’ll be punished.\nJust as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can\ncreate a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a\nverbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a\nparticular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’ t follow\nthrough. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability\npartners and sign of f on the contract with you.\nBryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, T ennessee, was the first\nperson I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of his son,' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 171}page_content='Harris realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit\ncontract between himself, his wife, and his personal trainer . The first\nversion read, “Bryan’ s #1 objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating\ncorrectly again so he feels better , looks better , and is able to hit his long-\nterm goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”\nBelow that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal\noutcome:\nPhase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.\nPhase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.\nPhase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout\nprogram in Q3.\nFinally , he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to his\ngoal. For example, “W rite down all food that he consumes each day and\nweigh himself each day .”\nAnd then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’ t do\nthese two items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will\nhave to dress up each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the\nquarter . Dress up is defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts.\nHe will also give Joey (his trainer) $200 to use as he sees fit if he misses\none day of logging food.”\nAt the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the\ncontract.\nMy initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and\nunnecessary , especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that\nsigning the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this\npart,” he said, “I start slacking almost immediately .”\nThree months later , after hitting his tar gets for Q1, Harris upgraded his\ngoals. The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and\nprotein tar gets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh\nhimself, he had to give his wife $500 to use as she saw fit. Perhaps most\npainfully , if he for got to run sprints, he had to dress up for work every day\nand wear an Alabama hat the rest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his\nbeloved Auburn team.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 172}page_content='The strategy worked. W ith his wife and trainer acting as accountability\npartners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day ,\nHarris lost the weight.  *\nTo make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them\npainful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to\ndo exactly that.\nEven if you don’ t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply\nhaving an accountability partner is useful. The comedian Mar garet Cho\nwrites a joke or song every day . She does the “song a day” challenge with a\nfriend, which helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that someone is\nwatching can be a powerful motivator . You are less likely to procrastinate or\ngive up because there is an immediate cost. If you don’ t follow through,\nperhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy . Suddenly , you are not only\nfailing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your\npromises to others.\nYou can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in\nBoulder , Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’ t, he\nhas a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’ s 6:10 and I’m not up\nbecause I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my\nalarm didn’ t malfunction.”\nWe are always trying to present our best selves to the world. W e comb\nour hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know\nthese habits are likely to get a positive reaction. W e want to get good grades\nand graduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates\nand our friends and family . We care about the opinions of those around us\nbecause it helps if others like us. This is precisely why getting an\naccountability partner or signing a habit contract can work so well.\nChapter Summary\nThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it\nunsatisfying  .\nWe are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 173}page_content='An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction.

Phelps has\nwon more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more than\nany Olympian in any sport.\nFewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a\nfantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who\nholds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance\nrunners of all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile,\n1,500-meter , and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens,\nGreece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.\nThese two athletes are wildly dif ferent in many ways. (For starters, one\ncompeted on land and the other in water .) But most notably , they dif fer\nsignificantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is\nsix feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch dif ference in height, the\ntwo men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El\nGuerrouj wear the same length inseam on their pants.\nHow is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a\nvery long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly\nlong legs and a short upper body , an ideal frame for distance running.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 177}page_content='Now , imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports. Given\nhis remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an Olympic-\ncaliber distance runner with enough training? It’ s unlikely . At peak fitness,\nPhelps weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El Guerrouj,\nwho competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. T aller runners are heavier\nrunners, and every extra pound is a curse when it comes to distance\nrunning. Against elite competition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.\nSimilarly , El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history , but it’ s\ndoubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer . Since 1976,\nthe average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’ s 1,500-meter run\nis five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold\nmedalists in the men’ s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches.\nSwimmers tend to be tall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for\npulling through the water . El Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage\nbefore he ever touched the pool.\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right\nfield of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with\nsports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to\nstick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like\nMichael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to\nplay a game where the odds are in your favor .\nEmbracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that\npeople are born with dif ferent abilities. Some people don’ t like to discuss\nthis fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’ s no fun to talk\nabout things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism\nmakes it sound like certain individuals are destined for success and others\ndoomed to failure. But this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes\non behavior .\nThe strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily\nchanged, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable\ncircumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If\nyou want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very useful. If you\nwant to perform a gymnastics routine, being seven feet tall is a great\nhindrance. Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the\nutility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the\nqualities that determine success.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 178}page_content='This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as\nwell. I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so\nmuch when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords.\nCompetence is highly dependent on context.\nThe people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained,\nthey are also well suited to the task. And this is why , if you want to be truly\ngreat, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\nIn short: genes do not determine your destiny . They determine your areas\nof opportunity . As physician Gabor Mate notes, “  Genes can predispose, but\nthey don’ t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed\nto success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The\nkey is to direct your ef fort toward areas that both excite you and match your\nnatural skills, to align your ambition with your ability .\nThe obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my\nfavor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?”\nThe first place we will look for an answer is by understanding your\npersonality .\nHOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS\nYour genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed,\nbeneath the surface of every behavior  . Genes have been shown to influence\neverything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your\nlikelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs,\nalcohol, or nicotine. There’ s a strong genetic component to how obedient or\nrebellious you are when facing authority , how vulnerable or resistant you\nare to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even\nhow captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending\na concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’ s College in\nLondon, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to\nsee if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’ t find a\nsingle one that isn’ t influenced by our genes.”\nBundled together , your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to\na particular personality . Your personality is the set of characteristics that is\nconsistent from situation to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 179}page_content='personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into\nfive spectrums of behavior .\n1. Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to\ncautious and consistent on the other .\n2. Conscientiousness: or ganized and ef ficient to easygoing and\nspontaneous.\n3. Extroversion: outgoing and ener getic to solitary and reserved (you\nlikely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).\n4. Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and\ndetached.\n5. Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.\nAll five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for\ninstance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the\nnursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away . When the\nresearchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies\nwho turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts.\nThose who turned away were more likely to become introverts.\nPeople who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm.\nThey also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays\nan important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act\nas a natural antidepressant. Y ou can easily imagine how someone with more\noxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing thank-you notes or\norganizing social events.\nAs a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all\npeople possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend\nto be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to\nhypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for\nnoticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative\ncues in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.\nOur habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no\ndoubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted\npreferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than for others.\nYou don’ t have to apologize for these dif ferences or feel guilty about them,' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 180}page_content='but you do have to work with them. A person who scores lower on\nconscientiousness, for example, will be less likely to be orderly by nature\nand may need to rely more heavily on environment design to stick with\ngood habits. (As a reminder for the less conscientious readers among us,\nenvironment design is a strategy we discussed in Chapters 6 and 12.)\nThe takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your\npersonality . * People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder , but if\nyou prefer rock climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your exercise\nhabit around your interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you\nfind that low-fat works for you, then more power to you. If you want to read\nmore, don’ t be embarrassed if you prefer steamy romance novels over\nnonfiction. Read whatever fascinates you.  * You don’ t have to build the\nhabits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not\nthe one that is most popular .\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction.\nFind it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the\ncore idea behind the 4th Law .\nTailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is not\nthe end of the story . Let’ s turn our attention to finding and designing\nsituations where you’re at a natural advantage.\nHOW T O FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR\nFAVOR\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for\nmaintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory , you can enjoy\nalmost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that\ncome easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be\nmore competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They\nstay ener gized because they are making progress where others have failed,\nand because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities,\nwhich not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even\nhigher -quality work. It’ s a virtuous cycle.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong habit and life is\na struggle.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 181}page_content='How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we covered\nin the 3rd Law: make it easy  . In many cases, when people pick the wrong\nhabit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too dif ficult. When a\nhabit is easy , you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful,\nyou are more likely to feel satisfied. However , there is another level to\nconsider . In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, any area\ncan become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure you’re\nplaying the right game for your skillset. How do you figure that out?\nThe most common approach is trial and error . Of course, there’ s a\nproblem with this strategy: life is short. Y ou don’ t have time to try every\ncareer , date every eligible bachelor , or play every musical instrument.\nThankfully , there is an ef fective way to manage this conundrum, and it is\nknown as the explor e/exploit trade-off  .\nIn the beginning of a new activity , there should be a period of\nexploration. In relationships, it’ s called dating. In college, it’ s called the\nliberal arts. In business, it’ s called split testing. The goal is to try out many\npossibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.\nAfter this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best\nsolution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally . The proper\nbalance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently\nwinning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you\ncontinue to explore, explore, explore.\nIn the long-run it is probably most ef fective to work on the strategy that\nseems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep\nexploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks\nemployees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their of ficial job and 20\npercent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of\nblockbuster products like AdW ords and Gmail.\nThe optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If you\nhave a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes\nmore sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a\ngood amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say , as you\ncome up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best\nsolution you’ve found so far and get some results.\nAs you explore dif ferent options, there are a series of questions you can\nask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 182}page_content='most satisfying to you:\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others?  The mark of whether\nyou are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can\nhandle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you\nenjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that\nhurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.\nWhat makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you\nenter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the\nworld fades away . This blend of happiness and peak performance is\nwhat athletes and performers experience when they are “in the zone.”\nIt is nearly impossible to experience a flow state and not find the task\nsatisfying at least to some degree.\nWher e do I get gr eater r eturns than the average person?  We are\ncontinually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is\nmore likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor .\nWhen I started writing at jamesclear .com, my email list grew very\nquickly . I wasn’ t quite sure what I was doing well, but I knew that\nresults seemed to be coming faster for me than for some of my\ncolleagues, which motivated me to keep writing.\nWhat comes naturally to me?  For just a moment, ignore what you\nhave been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others\nexpect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to\nme? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No\ninternal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-\ncriticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you\nfeel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\nTo be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and\nHicham El Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that\nare highly valued by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 183}page_content='those abilities. W e all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great\namong us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good\nfortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.\nBut what if you don’ t want to leave it up to luck?\nIf you can’ t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor , create\none. Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert  , says, “  Everyone has at\nleast a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some ef fort. In\nmy case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And\nI’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it\nbig, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can\ndraw well and write jokes. It’ s the combination of the two that makes what I\ndo so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a\ntopic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.”\nWhen you can’ t win by being better , you can win by being dif ferent. By\ncombining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it\neasier to stand out. Y ou can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for\nyears of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win\nthe game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that\nfavors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.\nIn college, I designed my own major , biomechanics, which was a\ncombination of physics, chemistry , biology , and anatomy . I wasn’ t smart\nenough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so I created\nmy own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking the courses I\nwas interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also easier to\navoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. After all, nobody else\nwas taking the same combination of classes, so who could say if they were\nbetter or worse?\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad\ngenetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for\nothers to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the\naverage arm wrestler , but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm\nwrestling because the arm wrestling champ has very specific strength. Even\nif you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best\nin a very narrow category .\nBoiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. Y ou can’ t control\nwhether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 184}page_content='it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment,\nyou can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to\none where they are in your favor .\nHOW T O GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell\nus what  to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to\nspend our time and ener gy. We know which types of opportunities to look\nfor and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our\nnature, the better our strategy can be.\nBiological dif ferences matter . Even so, it’ s more productive to focus on\nwhether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to\nsomeone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability\nhas nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your\ncapabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have  limits that\nthey rarely exert the ef fort required to get close to them.\nFurthermore, genes can’ t make you successful if you’re not doing the\nwork. Y es, it’ s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes,\nbut if you haven’ t put in the same reps, it’ s impossible to say if you have\nbeen dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those\nyou admire, don’ t explain away their success as luck.\nIn summary , one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying\nover the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and\nskills. W ork hard on the things that come easy .\nChapter Summary\nThe secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right\nfield of competition.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy . Pick the wrong habit and life\nis a struggle.\nGenes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful\nadvantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 185}page_content='unfavorable circumstances.\nHabits are easier when they align with your natural abilities.

Labor laws were loose back\nthen and the boy managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50\napiece.\nWithin a year , he had transitioned to Disney’ s magic shop, where he\nlearned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and\ntried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved\nwas not performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on\nbecoming a comedian.\nBeginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs\naround Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was\nrarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd\nwere too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night,\nhe literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.\nIt wasn’ t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better .\nHis first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his\nmaterial had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later , a\nten-minute show . At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty\nminutes at a time. He had to read three poems during the show just to make\nthe routine long enough, but his skills continued to progress.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 187}page_content='He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He\ntook a job as a television writer and, gradually , he was able to land his own\nappearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into\nbeing a regular guest on The T onight Show  and Satur day Night Live  .\nFinally , after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to fame.\nHe toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities in eighty\ndays. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend\none show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show\nin New Y ork. He catapulted to the top of his genre and became one of the\nmost successful comedians of his time.\nHis name is Steve Martin.\nMartin’ s story of fers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to stick\nwith habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is hard to\nimagine a situation that would strike fear into the hearts of more people\nthan performing alone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet\nSteve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years. In his words,\n“10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild\nsuccess.”\nWhy is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—whether\npracticing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while most of us\nstruggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather\nthan ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for\nmany years. While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent\nfindings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of\ndesire is to work on tasks of “  just manageable dif ficulty .”\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal\nzone of dif ficulty . If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against\na four -year -old, you will quickly become bored. It’ s too easy . You’ll win\nevery point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger\nFederer or Serena W illiams, you will quickly lose motivation because the\nmatch is too dif ficult.\nNow consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the\ngame progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few . You have a good\nchance of winning, but only if you really try . Your focus narrows,\ndistractions fade away , and you find yourself fully invested in the task at' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 188}page_content='hand. This is a challenge of just manageable dif ficulty and it is a prime\nexample of the Goldilocks Rule  .\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation\nwhen working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.\nNot too hard. Not too easy . Just right.\nTHE GOLDILOCKS RULE\nFIGURE 15:  Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just\nmanageable dif ficulty . In psychology research this is known as the Y erkes–\nDodson law , which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpoint\nbetween boredom and anxiety .\nMartin’ s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks Rule\nin practice. Each year , he expanded his comedy routine—but only by a\nminute or two. He was always adding new material, but he also kept a few' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 189}page_content='jokes that were guaranteed to get laughs. There were just enough victories\nto keep him motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him working hard.\nWhen you’re starting a new habit, it’ s important to keep the behavior as\neasy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’ t\nperfect. This is an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of\nBehavior Change.\nOnce a habit has been established, however , it’s important to continue to\nadvance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep\nyou engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve\na flow state  . *\nA flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed\nin an activity . Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that\nto achieve a state of flow , a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your\ncurrent ability . In real life it’ s typically not feasible to quantify the dif ficulty\nof an action in this way , but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains:\nworking on challenges of just manageable dif ficulty—something on the\nperimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.\nImprovement requires a delicate balance. Y ou need to regularly search\nfor challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough\nprogress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for\nthem to stay attractive and satisfying. W ithout variety , we get bored. And\nboredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.\nHOW T O ST AY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING\nON YOUR GOALS\nAfter my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined a\nweightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had\nworked with thousands of athletes during his long career , including a few\nOlympians. I introduced myself and we began talking about the process of\nimprovement.\n“What’ s the dif ference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I\nasked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’ t?”\nHe mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But\nthen he said something I wasn’ t expecting: “At some point it comes down' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 190}page_content='to who can handle the boredom of training every day , doing the same lifts\nover and over and over .”\nHis answer surprised me because it’ s a dif ferent way of thinking about\nwork ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals.\nWhether it’ s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all\ncomes down to passion.” Or , “You have to really want it.” As a result, many\nof us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that\nsuccessful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach\nwas saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as\neveryone else. The dif ference is that they still find a way to show up despite\nthe feelings of boredom.\nMastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the\nmore boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been\nmade and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it\nhappens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a few days\nin a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip\ndoesn’ t feel like much. Things are going well. It’ s easy to rationalize taking\na day of f because you’re in a good place.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. W e get bored\nwith habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes\nexpected. And as our habits become ordinary , we start derailing our\nprogress to seek novelty . Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never -\nending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next,\none business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in\nmotivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still\nworking. As Machiavelli noted, “  Men desire novelty to such an extent that\nthose who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing\nbadly .”\nPerhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those\nthat provide continuous forms of novelty . Video games provide visual\nnovelty . Porn provides sexual novelty . Junk foods provide culinary novelty .\nEach of these experiences of fer continual elements of surprise.\nIn psychology , this is known as a variable r ewar d . * Slot machines are\nthe most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every\nnow and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 191}page_content='varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances\nmemory recall, and accelerates habit formation.\nVariable rewards won’ t create a craving—that is, you can’ t take a reward\npeople are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it\nwill change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the\ncravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.\nThe sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and\nfailure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’ t.\nYou need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough\n“wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the benefits of following the\nGoldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on\nchallenges of just manageable dif ficulty is a good way to keep things\ninteresting.\nOf course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you\nwouldn’ t want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some\nof the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly . If Uber only\npicked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer .\nAnd if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended up with a\nclean mouth, I think I’d skip it.\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever . At some\npoint, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-\nimprovement: you have to fall in love with boredom.\nWe all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we\nwould like to fulfill, but it doesn’ t matter what you are trying to become\nbetter at, if you only do the work when it’ s convenient or exciting, then\nyou’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\nI can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it,\nthere will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business,\nthere will be days when you don’ t feel like showing up. When you’re at the\ngym, there will be sets that you don’ t feel like finishing. When it’ s time to\nwrite, there will be days that you don’ t feel like typing. But stepping up\nwhen it’ s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’ s what makes the\ndifference between a professional and an amateur .\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way .\nProfessionals know what is important to them and work toward it with\npurpose; amateurs get pulled of f course by the ur gencies of life.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 192}page_content='David Cain, an author and meditation teacher , encourages his students to\navoid being “fair -weather meditators.” Similarly , you don’ t want to be a\nfair-weather athlete or a fair -weather writer or a fair -weather anything.\nWhen a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it\nin any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’ t right.\nThey might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in.\nThere have been a lot of sets that I haven’ t felt like finishing, but I’ve\nnever regretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of articles I\nhaven’ t felt like writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule.\nThere have been a lot of days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted\nshowing up and working on something that was important to me.\nThe only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing\nthe same thing over and over . You have to fall in love with boredom.\nChapter Summary\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation\nwhen working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current\nabilities.\nThe greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.\nAs habits become routine, they become less interesting and less\nsatisfying.

In chess, it is only after\nthe basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a\nplayer can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information\nthat is memorized opens up the mental space for more ef fortful thinking.\nThis is true for any endeavor . When you know the simple movements so\nwell that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay\nattention to more advanced details. In this way , habits are the backbone of\nany pursuit of excellence.\nHowever , the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition\ndevelops fluency , speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic,\nyou become less sensitive to feedback. Y ou fall into mindless repetition. It\nbecomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on\nautopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better .\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The\ndownside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and\nstop paying attention to little errors. Y ou assume you’re getting better\nbecause you’re gaining experience. In reality , you are merely reinforcing\nyour current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown\nthat once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline  in\nperformance over time.\nUsually , this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry . You don’ t\nneed a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 194}page_content='your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. W ith habits like these, good\nenough is usually good enough. The less ener gy you spend on trivial\nchoices, the more you can spend it on what really matters.\nHowever , when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite\nlevels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. Y ou can’ t repeat\nthe same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are\nnecessary , but not suf ficient for mastery . What you need is a combination of\nautomatic habits and deliberate practice.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nTo become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. Basketball\nplayers need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on\nto mastering layups with their nondominant hand. Sur geons need to repeat\nthe first incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed,\nso that they can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during sur gery.\nBut after one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the ef fortful\npart of the work and begin building the next habit.\nMastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of\nsuccess, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this\nnew habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your\ndevelopment. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it\ndoesn’ t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your ener gy into the\nnext challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance.

Establish a system for reflection and review .\nHOW T O REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS\nIn 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball\nteams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way . The team\nstarted the 1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “  The\npundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of\nbasketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly , the\nLakers stumbled in the 1986 playof fs and suf fered a season-ending defeat in\nthe W estern Conference Finals. The “best team in the history of basketball”\ndidn’ t even play for the NBA championship.\nAfter that blow , Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his\nplayers had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’ t want to\nsee flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He\nwanted the Lakers to play up to their potential, night after night. In the\nsummer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a system that he called\nthe Career Best Ef fort program or CBE.\n“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their\nbasketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this T aking Their\nNumber . We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build\nhim into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and\nthen improve upon his averages.”\nAfter determining a player ’s baseline level of performance, Riley added\na key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1\npercent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE,\nor Career Best Ef fort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we\ndiscussed in Chapter 1, the Lakers sought peak performance by getting\nslightly better each day .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 197}page_content='Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or\nstatistics but about giving your “best ef fort spiritually and mentally and\nphysically .” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you\nwhen you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls,\ngoing after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a\nteammate when the player he’ s guarding has sur ged past him, and other\n‘unsung hero’ deeds.”\nAs an example, let’ s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at\nthe time—had 1 1 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in\na game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a\nloose ball (+1). Finally , he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary\ngame.\nThe positive numbers (1 1 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we\nsubtract the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally , we divide 29 by 33\nminutes played.\n29/33 = 0.879\nMagic’ s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated\nfor all of a player ’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was\nasked to improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each\nplayer ’s current CBE to not only their past performances but also those of\nother players in the league. As Riley put it, “W e rank team members\nalongside league opponents who play the same position and have similar\nrole definitions.”\nSportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top\nperformers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and\nmeasured them against the corresponding players on his own roster . Solid,\nreliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players\nscored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his\ncareer , often scored over 1,000.”\nThe Lakers also emphasized year -over -year progress by making\nhistorical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “W e stacked the month of\nNovember 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether\nthey were doing better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 198}page_content='showed them how their performance figures for December 1986, stacked up\nagainst November ’s.”\nThe Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later , they\nwere NBA champions. The following year , Pat Riley led his team to\nanother title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win\nback-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “  Sustaining an\neffort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be\nsuccessful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way\nevery time.”\nThe CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and\nreview . The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most\nout of what they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than\ndeclined.\nReflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits\nbecause it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider\npossible paths for improvement. W ithout reflection, we can make excuses,\ncreate rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. W e have no process for\ndetermining whether we are performing better or worse compared to\nyesterday .\nTop performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and\nreview , and the process doesn’ t have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud\nKipchoge is one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic\ngold medalist. He still takes notes after every practice in which he reviews\nhis training for the day and searches for areas that can be improved.\nSimilarly , gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a\nscale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on her nutrition and how well she slept.\nShe also records the times posted by other swimmers. At the end of each\nweek, her coach goes over her notes and adds his thoughts.\nIt’s not just athletes, either . When comedian Chris Rock is preparing\nfresh material, he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of times and\ntest hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records which bits\ngo over well and where he needs to make adjustments. The few killer lines\nthat survive will form the backbone of his new show .\nI know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in\nwhich they record the major decisions they make each week, why they\nmade them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 199}page_content='choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and\nwhere they went wrong.  *\nImprovement is not just about learning habits, it’ s also about fine-tuning\nthem. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right\nthings and make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley\nadjusting the ef fort of his players on a nightly basis. Y ou don’ t want to keep\npracticing a habit if it becomes inef fective.\nPersonally , I employ two primary modes of reflection and review . Each\nDecember , I perform an Annual Review  , in which I reflect on the previous\nyear. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I\npublished, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and\nmore.  * Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three\nquestions:\n1. What went well this year?\n2. What didn’ t go so well this year?\n3. What did I learn?\nSix months later , when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity\nReport  . Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps\nme realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I\nuse it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been\nliving in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and\nhow I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.  *\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:\n1. What are the core values that drive my life and work?\n2. How am I living and working with integrity right now?\n3. How can I set a higher standard in the future?\nThese two reports don’ t take very long—just a few hours per year—but\nthey are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that\nhappens when I don’ t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder\nto revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 200}page_content='become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I should\nupgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my\nefforts back and focus on the fundamentals.\nReflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are\npowerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about\nevery daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch\naway . You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.\nThere is too much feedback. Conversely , never reviewing your habits is like\nnever looking in the mirror . You aren’ t aware of easily fixable flaws—a\nspot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback.\nPeriodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a\nconversational distance. Y ou can see the important changes you should\nmake without losing sight of the bigger picture. Y ou want to view the entire\nmountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley .\nFinally , reflection and review of fers an ideal time to revisit one of the\nmost important aspects of behavior change: identity .\nHOW T O BREAK THE BELIEFS THA T HOLD YOU BACK\nIn the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your\ndesired identity . As you latch on to that new identity , however , those same\nbeliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working\nagainst you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to\ndeny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of\nthe greatest downsides of building habits.\nThe more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to\nour identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. Y ou see\nthis in every industry . The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching\nmethods and sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran\nmanager who is committed to doing things “his way .” The sur geon who\ndismisses the ideas of her younger colleagues. The band who produces a\nmind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling\nto an identity , the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\nOne solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an\noverwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 201}page_content='Graham, “  keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define\nyou, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you\ntie everything up in being the point guard or the partner at the firm or\nwhatever else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If\nyou’re a vegan and then develop a health condition that forces you to\nchange your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis on your hands. When you\ncling too tightly to one identity , you become brittle. Lose that one thing and\nyou lose yourself.\nFor most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my\nidentity . After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself. When\nyou spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears,\nwho are you now?\nMilitary veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If\nyour identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier ,” what\nhappens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their\nidentity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the\nfounder .” If you have spent every waking moment working on your\nbusiness, how will you feel after you sell the company?\nThe key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such\nthat you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your\nparticular role changes.\n“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally\ntough and loves a physical challenge.”\n“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is\ndisciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”\n“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and\ncreates things.”\nWhen chosen ef fectively , an identity can be flexible rather than brittle.\nLike water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the\nchanging circumstances rather than against them.\nThe following quote from the Tao Te Ching  encapsulates the ideas\nperfectly:' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 202}page_content='Men ar e born soft and supple;\ndead, they ar e stiff and har d.\nPlants ar e born tender and pliant;\ndead, they ar e brittle and dry .\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\nis a disciple of death.\nWhoever is soft and yielding\nis a disciple of life.\nThe har d and stiff will be br oken.\nThe soft and supple will pr evail.\n—L AO TZU\nHabits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock\nus into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world\nis shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly\nchanging, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and\nbeliefs are still serving you.\nA lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.\nChapter Summary\nThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The\ndownside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery\nReflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious\nof your performance over time.\nThe tighter we cling to an identity , the harder it becomes to grow\nbeyond it.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 203}page_content='TConclusion\nThe Secret to Results That Last\nHERE IS AN  ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox,  *\nwhich talks about the ef fect one small action can have when repeated\nenough times. One formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one\ncoin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you\nwouldn’ t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another? And\nanother? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that no one\ncan be rich unless one coin can make him or her so.\nWe can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change transform\nyour life? It’ s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another?\nAnd another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your\nlife was transformed by one small change.\nThe holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but\na thousand of them. It’ s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a\nfundamental unit of the overall system.\nIn the beginning, small improvements can often seem meaningless\nbecause they get washed away by the weight of the system. Just as one coin\nwon’ t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or\nreading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable dif ference.\nGradually , though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one\nanother , the scales of life start to move. Each improvement is like adding a\ngrain of sand to the positive side of the scale, slowly tilting things in your\nfavor . Eventually , if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly , it\nfeels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working\nfor you rather than against you.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 204}page_content='Over the course of this book, we’ve looked at dozens of stories about top\nperformers. W e’ve heard about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning\nartists, business leaders, lifesaving physicians, and star comedians who\nhave all used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to\nthe top of their field. Each of the people, teams, and companies we have\ncovered has faced dif ferent circumstances, but ultimately progressed in the\nsame way: through a commitment to tiny , sustainable, unrelenting\nimprovements.\nSuccess is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to\nimprove, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re having\ntrouble changing your habits, the problem isn’ t you. The problem is your\nsystem. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’ t\nwant to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.”\nAs this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. W ith the Four\nLaws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you\ncan use to build better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit\nwill be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious  . Other times\nyou won’ t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive  . In many\ncases, you may find that a habit will be too dif ficult and you’ll need to make\nit easy  . And sometimes, you won’ t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need\nto make it satisfying  .\nBehaviors ar e effortless her e. Behaviors ar e difficult her e.\nObvious Invisible\nAttractive Unattractive\nEasy Hard\nSatisfying Unsatisfying\nYou want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by\nmaking them obvious, attractive, easy , and satisfying.

There is no finish line. There is no\npermanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate\nthrough the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next\nbottleneck.

Always looking for the next way to get 1\npercent better .\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop making\nimprovements. It’ s remarkable what you can build if you just don’ t stop.

This framework not only teaches us how\nto create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human\nbehavior .\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\nIn this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common\nsense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to\nclarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing\nhuman behavior . Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it\neverywhere.\nAwareness comes befor e desir e. A craving is created when you assign\nmeaning to a cue. Y our brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe\nyour current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you\nhave noticed an opportunity .\nHappiness is simply the absence of desir e. When you observe a cue,\nbut do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current\nsituation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 209}page_content='or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no\nurge to feel dif ferently . Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer\nwant to change your state.\nHowever , happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes\nalong. As Caed Budris says, “  Happiness is the space between one desire\nbeing fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suf fering is the space\nbetween craving a change in state and getting it.\nIt is the  idea of pleasur e that we chase.  We seek the image of pleasure\nthat we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what\nit will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling\nof satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist\nVictor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must\nensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into pr oblems.\nThe first step in any behavior is observation. Y ou notice a cue, a bit of\ninformation, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then\nyou are at peace.\nCraving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving\nis the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Y our desires are not\nrunning rampant. Y ou do not crave a change in state. Y our mind does not\ngenerate a problem for you to solve. Y ou’re simply observing and existing.\nWith a big enough  why you can over come any  how . Friedrich\nNietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “  He who has\na why to live for can bear almost any how .” This phrase harbors an\nimportant truth about human behavior . If your motivation and desire are\ngreat enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when\nit is quite dif ficult. Great craving can power great action—even when\nfriction is high.\nBeing curious is better than being smart.  Being motivated and curious\ncounts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart\nwill never deliver results on its own because it doesn’ t get you to act. It is\ndesire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior . As Naval Ravikant says,\n“The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”\nEmotions drive behavior . Every decision is an emotional decision at\nsome level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only\nfeel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 210}page_content='damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking\naction but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them.\nThis is why craving comes befor e response. The feeling comes first, and\nthen the behavior .\nWe can only be rational and logical  after  we have been emotional.\nThe primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think.\nOur first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is\noptimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow ,\nconscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.”\nPsychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments)\nversus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the\nrationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two\nare aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are\nnot.\nYour r esponse tends to follow your emotions.  Our thoughts and\nactions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is\nlogical. T wo people can notice the same set of facts and respond very\ndifferently because they run those facts through their unique emotional\nfilter . This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more\npowerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel\nemotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions\ncan be such a threat to wise decision making.\nPut another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the\none that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. T o approach a\nsituation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your\nresponse on the data rather than the emotion.\nSuffering drives pr ogress. The source of all suf fering is the desire for a\nchange in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change\nyour state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes\nhumanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a\nhigher level. W ith craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. W ithout craving,\nwe are satisfied but lack ambition.\nYour actions r eveal how badly you want something.  If you keep\nsaying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’ t really\nwant it. It’ s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Y our actions\nreveal your true motivations.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 211}page_content='Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.  Response (sacrifice of ener gy)\nalways precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner ’s high”\nonly comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the ener gy is\nspent.\nSelf-contr ol is difficult because it is not satisfying.  A reward is an\noutcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control inef fective\nbecause inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting\ntemptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space\nfor the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather\nthan satisfy it.\nOur expectations determine our satisfaction.  The gap between our\ncravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking\naction. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive\n(surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the\nfuture. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then\nwe are less likely to do so.\nFor example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If\nyou expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Y our expectation\nchanges your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high\nexpectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low\nexpectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the\nsame, you feel satisfied.\nSatisfaction = Liking – W anting\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca’ s famous quote, “  Being poor is not\nhaving too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes,\nyou’ll always be unsatisfied. Y ou’re perpetually putting more weight on the\nproblem than the solution.\nHappiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it\ntook me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that\nmilestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. W e celebrated. I felt excited\nand motivated. A few years later , I realized that one thousand people were\nsigning up each day . And yet I didn’ t even think to tell anyone. It felt\nnormal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 212}page_content='experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’ t until a few days later that I\nrealized how absurd it was that I wasn’ t celebrating something that would\nhave seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.\nThe pain of failur e corr elates to the height of expectation.  When\ndesire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something\nyou want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’ t think much\nabout in the first place. This is why people say , “I don’ t want to get my\nhopes up.”\nFeelings come both befor e and after the behavior . Before acting, there\nis a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a\nfeeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.\nCue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\nHow we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we\nfeel.\nDesir e initiates. Pleasur e sustains.  Wanting and liking are the two\ndrivers of behavior . If it’ s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire\nand craving are what initiate a behavior . But if it’ s not enjoyable, you have\nno reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior .\nFeeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.\nHope declines with experience and is r eplaced by acceptance.  The\nfirst time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Y our\nexpectation (cravings) is based solely on pr omise  . The second time around,\nyour expectation is grounded in reality . You begin to understand how the\nprocess works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate\nprediction and acceptance of the likely outcome.\nThis is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick\nor weight-loss scheme. New plans of fer hope because we don’ t have any\nexperiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more\nappealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As\nAristotle noted, “Y outh is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.”\nPerhaps this can be revised to “Y outh is easily deceived because it only\nhopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in.

In 1954,\nJames Olds and Peter Milner , two neuroscientists at McGill University , decided to implant an\nelectrode deep into the center of a rat’ s brain. The precise placement of the electrode was\nlargely happenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind remained a mystery . But Olds\nand Milner got lucky . They inserted the needle right next to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a\npart of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a piece of chocolate\ncake, or listen to a favorite pop song, or watch your favorite team win the W orld Series, it is\nyour NAcc that helps you feel so happy . But Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too\nmuch pleasure can be fatal. They placed the electrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran\na small current into each wire, making the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed\nthat the rodents lost interest in everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship\nbehavior ceased. The rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages, transfixed by their\nbliss. W ithin days, all of the animals had perished. They died of thirst.

Its real-world origin was as a gambit\nemployed by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at\nthe University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art & Fear ’ it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry\ntold it to me—except I replaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored.\nAdmittedly , it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art medium being discussed,\nbut David Bayles (co-author) & I are both photographers ourselves, and at the time we were\nconsciously trying to broaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing\nthing to me is that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the moral of the story\nappears to hold equally true straight across the whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts,\nfor that matter).” Later in that same email, Orland said, “Y ou have our permission to reprint\nany or all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on\npublishing an adapted version, which combines their telling of the ceramics story with facts' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 230}page_content='from the original source of Uelsmann’ s photography students.

Even in\nacademic circles, these words are often used interchangeably\nwithout much nitpicking (for once). Nonconscious  is the term I’m\ngoing to use because it is broad enough to encompass both the\nprocesses of the mind we could never consciously access and the\nmoments when we are simply not paying attention to what\nsurrounds us.

Her\nyoung son stepped onto the Shinkansen, one of Japan’ s famous\nbullet trains that travel at over two hundred miles per hour , just as\nthe doors were closing. She was left outside on the platform and\njammed her arm through the door to grab him. W ith her arm stuck\nin the door , the train was about to take of f, but right before it pulled\naway an employee performed a safety check by Pointing-and-\nCalling up and down the platform. In less than five seconds, he\nnoticed the woman and managed to stop the train from leaving.

The brain\noverestimates the danger of anything that seems like an immediate\nthreat but has almost no likelihood of actually occurring: your\nplane crashing during a bit of turbulence, a bur glar breaking in\nwhile you’re home alone, a terrorist blowing up the bus you’re on.\nMeanwhile, it underestimates what appears to be a distant threat\nbut is actually very likely: the steady accumulation of fat from\neating unhealthy food, the gradual decay of your muscles from\nsitting at a desk, the slow creep of clutter when you fail to tidy up.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 280}page_content='* Interested readers can find a habit tracker template at\natomichabits.com/tracker  .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 281}page_content='* You can see the actual Habit Contracts used by Bryan Harris and\nget a blank template at atomichabits.com/contract  .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 282}page_content='* If you are interested in taking a personality test, you can find\nlinks to the most reliable tests here: atomichabits.com/personality  .' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 283}page_content='* If it’s Harry Potter on repeat, I feel you.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 284}page_content='* I have a pet theory about what happens when we achieve a flow\nstate. This isn’ t confirmed. It’ s just my guess. Psychologists\ncommonly refer to the brain as operating in two modes: System 1\nand System 2. System 1 is fast and instinctual. Generally speaking,\nprocesses you can perform very quickly (like habits) are governed\nby System 1. Meanwhile, System 2 controls thinking processes that\nare more ef fortful and slow—like calculating the answer to a\ndifficult math problem. W ith regard to flow , I like to imagine\nSystem 1 and System 2 as residing on opposite ends of the\nspectrum of thinking. The more automatic a cognitive process is,\nthe more it slides toward the System 1 side of the spectrum. The\nmore ef fortful a task is, the more it slides toward System 2. Flow , I\nbelieve, resides on the razor ’s edge between System 1 and System\n2. You are fully using all of your automatic and implicit knowledge\nrelated to the task while also working hard to rise to a challenge\nbeyond your ability . Both brain modes are fully engaged. The\nconscious and nonconscious are working perfectly in sync.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 285}page_content='* The discovery of variable rewards happened by accident. One\nday in the lab, the famous Harvard psychologist B. F . Skinner was\nrunning low on food pellets during one experiment and making\nmore was a time-consuming process because he had to manually\npress the pellets in a machine. This situation led him to “ask myself\nwhy every press of the lever had to be reinforced.” He decided to\nonly give treats to the rats intermittently and, to his surprise,\nvarying the delivery of food did not decrease behavior , but actually\nincreased it.' metadata={'source': 'AtomicHabits.pdf', 'page': 286}page_content='* I created a template for readers interested in keeping a decision\njournal.
